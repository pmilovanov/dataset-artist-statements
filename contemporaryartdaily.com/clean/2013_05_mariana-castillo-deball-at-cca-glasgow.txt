This exhibition presents the results of an intense period of research at the British Museum in London and accompanying residencies in Cove Park. Taking historical and archaeological Mayan writing and objects as a starting point, the exhibition guides us through the work of explorer and archaeologist Alfred Maudslay, Scottish artist Eduardo Paolozzi and anthropologist Alfred Gell who all developed various techniques to analyse diverse cultural objects. Deball responds to their investigations by offering a new body of work of her own which examines modes of objectification within visual cultures and the relationships it produces to ‘agency’, so often attached to various disciplines of artistic, ethnographic and historical nature.
The artist doesn’t simply reactivate the legacy of Gell, Maudslay and Paolozzi by celebrating forgotten ideas, instead she embraces the transformative potential objects can exert. Acknowledging that objects contribute to ‘factual’ knowledge about cultures, languages and societies, Mariana Castillo Deball constructs an active and almost ungraspable parallel that focuses our attention on how our image of different cultures is determined by the filter of objects.
