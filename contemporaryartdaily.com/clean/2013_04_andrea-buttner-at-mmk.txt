The Documenta artist Andrea Büttner (b. 1972) takes a critical look at the topic of poverty in her work. She examines how a sense of shame brought about by poverty affects aesthetic processes, and inquires into the relationships between conceptions of poverty in the art of the Late Modernist era, for example Arte Povera, and the poverty movements of the Middle Ages as exemplified by the voluntary poverty of religious orders.
At the MMK Zollamt she will address these themes in texts and photography, among other media. In a presentation encompassing altogether three exhibition phases, Büttner will also introduce a new room-size sound work. The latter will be based on the table talk conducted during a private dinner held at the MMK Zollamt. A display of pebbles painted by artists will also be on view.
With her conceptual approach, Andrea Büttner follows in the footsteps of such artists as Martin Kippenberger, Rosemarie Trockel and Hanne Darboven. At the same time, her formal language lends the themes as well as the conceptual aspects of her work urgent topicality.
