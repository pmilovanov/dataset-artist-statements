Bortolami is pleased to announce an exhibition of paintings by Shane Campbell, his first solo show in New York.
Taking cues from various points in the history of representational art, Campbell focuses intensively on the formal elements of painting. Through the repeated use of motifs or images and by working in series, recognizable images are reduced to symbols.
Parades are of ongoing interest for Campbell, who depicts this familiar setting with its customary details and characters including clowns, policemen, balloons and crowds. This concern began while he was a student, where he made paintings of half?time parades at university sporting events. Over the past few years, his parades have expanded into more general, less?specific landscapes that could be of any American town or city. The works depict various aspects of a single parade, from isolated details to full views.
Shane Campbell lives and works in Brooklyn, New York and is a 2007 graduate of the Yale MFA program in Painting. He recently won the ACACIA Grant 2009 and will participate in the Via Farini residency in Milan, Italy this September.
