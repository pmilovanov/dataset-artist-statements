Mr.I
Mr. I has lived in the neighborhood forever.
He often passes by this street, thinking about what he sees, again and again.
Looking out of the window, walking into a shop, eating on a public bench.
He may loose his mind in blurry thoughts, taking the same route, again and again.
Is Mr. I blind ? He has sharp eyes and a clear vision but, sometimes, likes to live in the dark.
Mr. I is so often there than nobody sees him anymore.
Mr. I has forgotten his name and wears the same clothes every day, without really knowing why.
Mr. I wishes to be invisible.
He fills all the places he walks into.
Mr. I is here.
