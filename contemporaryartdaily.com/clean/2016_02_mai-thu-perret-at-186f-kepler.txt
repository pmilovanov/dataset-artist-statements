My shadow was squatting behind me, counting beads I heard her say,
One oh two five easy
And I was shot
And in the wound a blinking eye
My mouth was a slot for copper pennies
Like milk
My senses run like milk
Out of me
There are certain limits
All around, there are duplicates
Copies!
No I no longer know
That I will soon fall
Then, running out of me
On little ticking legs
Men in purest code
I see them grow to a black spot
There it is
In my sights
Darkness
Obscenity
Then I forget
And it leaves me
Singing,
Imposters I know,
And I go away
On an inward turn
Time is a cage
Love is a face
That turns away
