The human body needs a certain amount of iodine to maintain normal, healthy metabolic function. A deficiency can make you sluggish. Too much iodine can be poisonous: abdominal pain, an increased heart rate, a metallic taste in your mouth, delirium, and in severe cases, brain damage. The symptoms, good and bad, are hidden with a blanketed list of familiar ailments, easily misdiagnosed; they can mimic the seemingly banal. In Andrei Koschmieder’s solo presentation at Real Fine Arts, the artist’s work sits between a similar balance of commonplace and affected.
A unique series of squid prints cover the longest wall in the gallery and use a combination of traditional Japanese fisherman cataloguing techniques—using actual squid ink—and drops of inkjet ink. In an attempt to protect itself from predators, the squid emits an ink bubble that moves across the wall in stages of camouflage. While pasting, the artist’s hand ripples the fragile pages and breaks the appearance of something wholly serial. 
Paper, resin and paint create the façade of corrugated metal boxes, which spread from a disrupted white canvas to a rusty stack of degraded material. As objects, the boxes stage a synthesis of industrial fabrication and natural wear and tear but the difference between the two is unclear. The repetition of form, both in the corrugated pattern and side-by-side or stacked rectangles is fractured by decay. And through a range of highs and lows, Koschmieder hints at the not so obvious. 
There’s some shrimp in there too.
