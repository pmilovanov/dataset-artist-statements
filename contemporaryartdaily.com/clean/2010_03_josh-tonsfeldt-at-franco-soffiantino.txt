Franco Soffiantino Gallery is pleased to present the exhibition 4: Cat Cos by Josh Tonsfeldt. This is the first European solo show of the American artist and will include videos, photographs, sculpture, and subtle transformations of the gallery space.
The title of the exhibition is taken from a photograph of an abandoned space the artist often passes on walks near his studio. In the image a bundle of encyclopedias rest among a pile of garbage. The juxtaposition of two types of archives within the image the encyclopedia as an alphabetical ordering of ideas, things, and places, and the garbage pile as an erratic accumulation of waste might provide an oblique entry point to the larger circulation of works within the exhibition.
While much of Tonsfeldtâ€™s work comes from his daily experience, it is in no way a snapshot of any particular activity. To this end he does not tie his projects to a specific subject, preferring instead to establish his sensibility and logic anew with each potential gesture. Scenes and figures are drawn into an unscripted collage of sound and vision. At its root lies a curiosity with the material world, a refusal to accept processes as a given, and an interest in bringing to the surface the subjective opacity of memory, association and desire.
