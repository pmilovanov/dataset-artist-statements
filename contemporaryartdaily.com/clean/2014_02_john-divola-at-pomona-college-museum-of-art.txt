 
With a career spanning four decades, John Divola is as distinctive for his commitment to the photographic community as for his thought-provoking work. Divola was born in Los Angeles in 1949. After graduating with a B.A. from California State University, Northridge, he entered the M.F.A. program at the University of California, Los Angeles. There, under the tutelage of Robert Heineken, the artist began to develop his own unique photographic practice, one that merges photography, painting, and conceptual art. In addition to his own studio practice, he teaches contemporary art in the California inland empire and writes on current photographic practice for a national audience. Although his influence and practice are widely recognized by curators, critics, scholars, and publishers alike, As Far As I Could Get will be the first solo presentation of Divolas work which remains under-studied and under-represented.
This exhibition is a collaborative project led by the Santa Barbara Museum of Art, and shown simultaneously at SBMA, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, and the Pomona College Museum of Art from September through December 2013. Although Divolas photographic series are diverse in subject matter, this approachâ€”one exhibition among three Southern California venues will emphasize the consistent conceptual and performative threads that run through Divolas entire body of work.
