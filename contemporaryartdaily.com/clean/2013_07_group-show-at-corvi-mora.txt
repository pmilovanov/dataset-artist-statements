Tommaso Corvi-Mora is proud to present a group exhibition including work by Dee Ferris, Dominique Gonzalez-Foerster, Adam Buick, Noor Ali Chagani and David Jones.
The aim of the exhibition is to present different ways of addressing an extended notion of landscape: landscape as the spirit of a place, connecting space and time.
Dee Ferris new paintings, completed just before the exhibition, mark her continuing exploration of landscape as a dystopian mirror of our desires.
Dominique Gonzalez-Foersters works, one from the early 1990s and the other from 2011, address her interest in biography and literature as primary source of her practice.
The exhibition will also include two works by potter Adam Buick: his ceramics literally incorporate fragments of the landscape, to underscore a deep identification with the Welsh environment he lives and works in.
Noor Ali Chaganis work in the exhibition, titled Silence, was made in 2012 as a tribute to Salman Taseer: Mr Taseer was the Governor of Punjab and was assassinated in 2011 by one of his bodyguards for having spoken against the so-called blasphemy laws in Pakistan.
David Jones (1895-1974) was a writer and artist, one of the foremost British modernist poets. His figure and his work have been the main pivot of the exhibition.
