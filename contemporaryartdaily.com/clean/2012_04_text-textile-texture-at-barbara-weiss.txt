Within each of these individual artistic approaches, different aesthetic perspectives can be identified that make use of textured structures, either in the sense of reproduction or reinterpretation. In this way, both on a conceptual as well as a material level, it can be understood as a metaphor for social and cultural aspects, for modes of production, for questions of feminism or even for discursive purposes of the reception of the modern.
