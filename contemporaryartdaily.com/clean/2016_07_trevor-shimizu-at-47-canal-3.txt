Babies cant see the cute stuffed animals and imagery on their mobiles and play mats very clearly. Most objects are blurry to newborn babies and can only be seen 8-15 inches away. The cute, friendly objects and images are actually for their parents. They help parents cope with the babys screaming, the diapers, and the sleep deprivation.
