Ridykeulous is a curatorial initiative founded in 2005 by Nicole Eisenman and A.L. Steiner to recalibrate the conversation surrounding queer and feminist art, reiterating these movements’ insistence on equality while critiquing their often insular terms. Ridykeulous’s projects take place in commercial galleries, major museums, and alternative art spaces, disseminating a clear message through highly visible public arenas. Intentionally provocative and even aggressive while simultaneously playful and humorous, Ridykeulous’s exhibitions, performances, and publications challenge the status quo and argue for a more multifaceted and inclusive approach to contemporary cultural production.
Ridykeulous presents an expanded version of its 2011 exhibition at Invisible-Exports in New York, Readykeulous: The Hurtful Healer. This presentation features a wide array of emotionally charged contributions by more than forty artists and activists in addition to selections from Ridykeulous’s own PATRIArchivesTM. Drawing connections across a diverse range of text-based media dating from the 1960s to the present—from artist Nancy Spero’s 1971 letter to Tracey Emin’s rousing neon sculpture and embroidery—the works on view confront a host of perceived injustices. In pairing archival materials and contemporary objects, the exhibition explores some of the most compelling issues of the last half-century— including feminism, the Vietnam War, queer liberation, and labor rights—through the voices of the artists themselves. Beginning March 7, the exhibition further extends into the Front Room gallery downstairs with a number of historically significant works of video art.
The exhibition will travel to the ICA Philadelphia from September 19–December 28, 2014.
