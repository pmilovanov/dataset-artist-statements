A quite large industrial extractor fan was used during the installation of this exhibition. Although not very economical in terms of running costs, the fan kept receipts, bills and take-away food containers from piling up. It also prevented dust from gathering on some sculptures and paintings. With an intake approximately the size of a doorway, the extractor was in operation over the majority of the installation period, turning the gallery into a giant hoover vacuuming itself from within. The gallery intern referred to the process of cleaning the enormous foam core filter as a Déjà vu.
