Tony Wight Gallery is pleased to present an exhibition of works by Tamar Halpern, Jacob Kassay, Carter Mull, Valerie Snobeck, Josh Tonsfeldt and Molly Zuckerman-Hartung.
This exhibition will focus on the obfuscation and confusion that takes place when gestures and signs are fragmented, layered, concealed, dampened and stifled, and the simultaneous opacity and openendedness which ensues.
