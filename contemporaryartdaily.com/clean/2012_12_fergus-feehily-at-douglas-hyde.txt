Paradise: [1] an enclosed garden [2] the garden of Eden [3] a place of bliss, felicity, or delight [4] heaven
In this series of exhibitions, artists are asked to make a selection of work that reflects their idea of The Paradise. Fergus Feehily has chosen to show a new installation about light and darkness; and especially about luminosity.
Feehily previously exhibited at the Douglas Hyde Gallery in 2009 with a solo show entitled Pavilion. The exhibition was accompanied by a publication with a text by the artist. Since then, his work has been shown widely, both in Ireland and internationally.
