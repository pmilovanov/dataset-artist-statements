Federica Schiavo Gallery is pleased to announce that American artist Karthik Pandian has released new works. He made them from marble dust, resin, roses, a ceramic penis, plaster, silicone, foundry wax, cardboard, paper, bronze, 16mm film, HD video, CGI, plasma, electricity, a spinal cord and digital photography. What was he thinking?
Karthik Pandian makes works in moving image and sculpture. His process is defined by a particular approach to vision: how to recognize the play of time, labor, and meaning in things. He transforms material and arranges seemingly disparate objects to render that play more visible.
Snails and Oysters is Pandianâ€™s first solo exhibition in Italy. This fall his work will be featured in the Present Future sector of Artissima.
