The Approach is pleased to present the latest exhibition of new paintings by the Dutch artist Rezi van Lankveld. Following a thorough re-evaluation of her creative process and a continuous search for intuitive painting, the artist has liberated these works from all remnants of concrete figuration. The importance of the medium remains unchanged, but the figures presented here are even further removed from the idea of implicit unity and synchrony; metamorphosed into varied shapes and patches of colour.
The paintings appear to be in constant motion, with undulating swirls reminiscent of human shapes and nature. Until now the general colour palette employed by the artist has been predominantly monochromatic, however the new paintings freely pair bold, contrasting colours, permitting them to attain a less curated form. The surface of the painting is now purposefully interrupted and mixed into near-collage. Each integrated layer of paint adds a textural dimension, accounting for the works’ strong bond with their materiality.
Consequently, the act of painting becomes similar to a dance, building the story of a movement, which refrains from any sort of recounting and aims to appeal to its viewers in a visceral manner. Through the medium’s immediacy and spontaneity the artist alludes to the individual nature of our lives, irreproducible and unpredictable until the end.
