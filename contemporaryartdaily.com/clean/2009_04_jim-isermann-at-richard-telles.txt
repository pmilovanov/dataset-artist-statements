Richard Telles Fine Art is pleased to present an exhibition of four new paintings by Jim Isermann.
Isermanns career spans over twenty-five years of combining fine art and modern design through playfully complex systems of abstraction. Utilizing a wide-range of materials, Isermann explores form and function in hand-made woven rugs, fabric-covered sculptural cubes, vinyl-patterned wall murals, and vacuum-formed wall modules, among other
work.
The series of new paintings that will be exhibited, along with four others exhibited at Corvi-Mora, London in 2008, are the first produced by the artist in twenty years. The paintings are algorithms based on the geometry of a recently commissioned vacuum-formed wall installation. The return to painting has allowed Isermann to embrace a more traditional studio practice derived from working with industrial materials and manufactured products. Though many artists use American design history in their work, Jim Isermann has long been at the forefront of these concerns.
Jim Isermann has exhibited extensively throughout the United States and Europe, and created numerous
commissioned installations for public spaces. His most recent exhibitions include Corvi Mora, London (2008), Deitch Projects, New York (2007), Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago (2006), Hammer Museum (2002), and the Portikus, Frankfurt am Main, Germany (2000). This will be Isermanns eighth solo exhibition at Richard Telles Fine Art.
