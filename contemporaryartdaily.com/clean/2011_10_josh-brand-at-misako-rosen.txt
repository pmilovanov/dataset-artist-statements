MISAKO &amp; ROSEN is pleased to announce our presentation of the debut exhibition in Japan by Wisconsin born (1980), New York based artist Joshua Brand. Brand received his BFA from The School of the Art Institute of Chicago (2002) and has exhibited at venues including White Columns (2007/09/11), Whitney Museum of American Art, Art Gallery of Ontario and Museum of Contemporary Photography, Chicago (all 2010) as well as Herald St, London (2008/09).
Brands photographs can be thought of as analogical objects. A picture here transfers meaning between the hand and memory, between feeling and photography, between touch and sight. For Brand the photographic object and image are less representation than reflection; existing in a direct relationship to memory and to the world. Thematized or systematic self-relfexivity is avoided in favor of an intimate, sometimes diaristic, chance-driven process of seeing and making. Resulting exhibitions are composed of straight and experimental photographs; installations are structured around physical, emotional, and symbolic spaces.
