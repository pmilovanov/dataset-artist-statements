There is a place on the east side of town
They know my face cause Im always around
A pillar of strength
A haven to turn to
The place where I learned to feel noble and proud
Yes its Bloomingdales
In a class beyond compare
The other stores all pale
Everything your heart desires will one day be on sale
At Bloomingdales
