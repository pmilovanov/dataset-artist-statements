Gedi Sibony is one of the most promising young artists working today, and his unconventional sculptures propose a new way of looking at the world and thinking about art. For his first-ever solo museum exhibition, this New York-based artist presents a site-specific installation of new and recent works. Using materials such as carpet, cardboard, hollow doors, and metal pipes, he playfully evokes the effortless magic of the mundane. Sibonys sculptures achieve a nonchalant awkwardness, a proud nudity, and an overall implausibility that bring together space, weight, and materiality in ways that seem happily accidental. In the context of the near-collapse of our
contemporary socio-political reality, these works quietly promote an economy of means, re-use, transparency, and the power and beauty of bare essentials.
A monographic catalogue published with JRP-Ringier accompanies the exhibition and includes an introduction by curator Anthony Huberman, an essay by French curator Fran√ßois Quintin, and an interview with the artist by Dia Art Foundation Director Philippe Vergne.
Over the past few years, Sibonys work has become increasingly visible in prominent group exhibitions such as the 2006 Whitney Biennial, and the New Museums inaugural exhibition Unmonumental, underlining the contemporary relevance of his practice. The Contemporary Art Museum St. Louis is the first to recognize Gedi Sibony in a significant one-person museum exhibition. Other recent one person exhibitions include FRAC Champagne-Ardenne, Reims, France (2008); Kunsthalle St, Gallen, St. Gallen, Switzerland (2007); Midway Contemporary Art, Minneapolis (2007); and gallery exhibitions at Galerie Neu, Berlin (2008); Greene Naftali, New York (2008), Zero, Milan (2008); and art:concept, Paris (2007). Sibony was born in 1973 in New York City.
