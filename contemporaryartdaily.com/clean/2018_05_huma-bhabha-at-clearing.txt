In celebration of Huma Bhabha’s site-specific commission installed at The Met’s Rooftop Garden, (titled We Come in Peace, on view until October 28th, 2018), Clearing Upper East Side is proud to present a selection of the artist’s recent sculptures and works on paper.
Huma Bhabha uses deteriorated and found materials in an entropic sculptural language that feels both ancient and prescient, often invoking the artifacts of art-history and civilization in primal, otherworldly forms. Huma Bhabha’s haunting figures can be viewed as a 21st century hybrid of ancient statuary and contemporary sculpture, while other works explore the poetics of abandoned and scavenged material, such as cork, styrofoam, mesh and rubber. Works on view include: Friend (2015), a painted bronze sculpture cast from styrofoam consumer packaging; Snakes (2013), a work made in metal and shredded tire; the wall-hanging Moment to Moment (2013 2014); plus two works on paper produced on the artist’s studio floor from the rubbings and overspray of her cork sculpture.
Clearing is thrilled to host this exhibition and to congratulate Huma Bhabha for her wonderful accomplishments. Bravissima, Huma!
