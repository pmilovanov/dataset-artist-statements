Contemporary Fine Arts is pleased to announce the solo exhibition ‘not for sale by Peter Doig.
With a selection of works from the last 20 years from German museums and international private collections, Contemporary Fine Arts shows Peter Doig in his first solo exhibition in Berlin in 10 years.
The exhibition rounds off the big international museum-retrospective of Peter Doig, which previously toured to Tate Britain, London, the Musée dArt moderne de la Ville de Paris and Schirn Kunsthalle in Frankfurt.
As we have been representing the artist since 1995, we are especially proud to be able to show all of the original Studio Film Club posters designed by Peter Doig.
The Studio Film Club is a non-commercial film club organized by Peter Doig and the artist Che Lovelace in Port of Spain, Trinidad, where the artist has lived with his family since 2002.
Weekly on Thursdays, international film productions are shown in Peter Doigs studio, without which an audience on the island of Trinidad would remain deprived of a tradition of programmed cinema. For every one of these the artist paints a film placard.
