James Lee Byars Lived Here presents a group of major works by Byars in the Palazzo Pesaro Papafava in Venice, from 4 June to 5 July 2009. The exhibition has been organised by Milton Keynes Gallery, and curated by its former Director, Michael Stanley.
Byars was a truly international artist who led a nomadic lifestyle and was a regular commuter between America, Japan and Europe. For Byars the city of Venice represented the union of East and West and it was central to the development of his practice; he created many works and performances in response to the city’s rich artistic context and he kept a home there for most of his life.
Works in the exhibition bear a direct connection to the artist’s relationship to Venice. The most important of these is The Angel, (1989), which will be shown in its own gilded room at Palazzo Papafava. The Angel is an ethereal sculpture comprising 125 hand-blown Murano glass spheres, each fragile sphere formed by a single breath of the glass blower.
During the first week of the exhibition, a late performance work of Byars, Five Points Make a Man, will be realised in Venice. The concept of five points make a man is one which Byars became increasingly fascinated with towards the end of his life that an arrangement of five points of any kind corresponds to the five points or extremities of the human figure in the mind of the viewer. The public performances take place at 2pm on 4, 5 and 6 June. Admission is free.
