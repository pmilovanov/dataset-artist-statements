Within popular culture, expression given to adolescent drives has only intensified as the genre of Teen Romance has been distilled and repackaged as Teen Paranormal Romance. Twilight, The Hunger Games, True Blood, and the Divergent Trilogy are also dystopic, psychosexual cyphers for the panoply of Obama-era ideological positions from revanchist religious, economic, and sexual politics to Libertarian fever-dream apocalypticism. This exhibition samples artistic production in the wake of a zeitgeist that has rendered the unconscious a derelict playground home to weeds of surrealism.
