Aleana Egan’s exhibition provides an intimate encounter with a single new sculpture. The form of a canopy suspended above low constructions on the floor gives some sense of the oppositions often found in the artist’s elusive work; traces of fleeting memories and interactions between people are revealed intuitively through the colour, texture and weight of the materials used.
Egan’s work is in part an attempt to communicate the mood and atmosphere that she finds in films, books and artworks. The Dressmaker, a painting by Margaret Clarke, from which the artist drew much of the spirit of her new sculpture, is included in the exhibition. A Letter to Three Wives, a 1949 film by Joseph L. Mankiewicz was also influential.
Aleana Egan’s solo show, day wears, took place at the Douglas Hyde Gallery in 2012. Her work was also included in our 2014 group exhibition, Dukkha. The Douglas Hyde Gallery would like to thank the artist, Crawford Art Gallery, Cork, and the Kerlin Gallery, Dublin, for their support of the exhibition.
