Tobias Rehberger (Esslingen, 1966, lives and works in Frankfurt) is undoubtedly one of the most influential and successful German artists of his generation. For twenty years now, he has been working on a consistent body of work in which he undermines artistic ideals such as genius and authenticity. Using strategies from the realm of design, Tobias Rehberger examines the meaning of art and what the future possibilities for art production are. The objects he creates are versatile and can be repeatedly adapted to the context in which they are meant to function. In this way, Rehbergers oeuvre evolves into an unpredictable and playful whirlpool of glitzy shapes and colours.
For his project at the Museum Dhondt-Dhaenens, Rehberger develops a series of large and colourful abstract sculptures. In Rehbergerâ€™s total project, the shadows cast by the sculptures on the surrounding walls are at least as important as the objects themselves. Special lighting effects and the slow rotation of the sculptures make that, at certain times of the day, the amorphous shadows on the walls form a hidden message.
