“It seems almost as though the gaze were divided into two incompatible and irreconcilable categories: perception on the one hand, and poetry on the other. What I am interested in, however, is in ending the balance between these two extremes. () Photography thus becomes a form of awareness on the boundary between the known and the unknown.”
The words of Luigi Ghirri (1943-1992) succinctly describe not only his photography, but his entire visual, conceptual, philosophical approach to the overarching everyday situation of his surroundings, in Scandiano, in Modena, in the environs of Reggio Emilia and Emilia-Romagna. His background, his upbringing, his education, his contact with the Modena conceptualists – all of these shaped Ghirri, making him the most innovative pioneer of Italian photography and an icon of international photography.
