Freddy is happy to present Hit the Road, a solo exhibition by New York-based artist Nicholas Buffon. Buffonâ€™s works refer directly to the urban landscape that he inhabits. Miniature building facades and mundane paraphernalia are lovingly re-created using paper, foam core, paint and glue, with the help of Google street view. These highly detailed yet scrappy little sculptures are imbued with sincerity that is bigger than the sum of their parts because they are approximate reproductions and clearly made by hand. One imagines Buffon as Geppetto working long hours in his studio, painting, cutting, and pasting as if he were chipping away at a block of wood that would one day become a real live boy.
With this exhibition, Buffon expands his neighborhood narrative with his newest concern the road. Freddy, in its miniaturized context, is seen as a gallery within a gallery within a gallery. An assortment of automobiles, including a delivery truck and a police car, are presented alongside traveling necessities: maps, snacks, drinks, and common road signs with words like, NO TURN ON RED, DIP, STOP, or DO NOT PASS.
Nicholas Buffon (born 1987, Seattle, WA) has exhibited at galleries including Callicoon Fine Arts, QT Gallery, The Hole, and Shoot the Lobster. Buffon is represented by Callicoon Fine Arts, New York.
