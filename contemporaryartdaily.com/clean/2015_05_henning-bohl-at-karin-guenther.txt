In the exhibition Fatal, Fatal, Kadath Fatal Henning Bohl presents an awning sculpture and a series of drawings which have been produced in the last two years. Recalling fragments of a cinematic sequence, the drawings develop a narrative structure, in which, with reference to the visual language of cosmic horror, elements of Bohl’s earlier sculptures and installations are put into fictional surroundings.
Subsequently the exhibition will be shown in the Blaffer Art Museum in Houston, in an expanded form – including a musical for awnings developed by Henning Bohl and Sergei Tcherepnin.
