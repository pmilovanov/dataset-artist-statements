Michaela Eichwald creates alchemical paintings using the formal language of gestural abstraction with its often muddy palette and roughly textured surfaces, sometimes employing less conventional materials instead of canvas to work on. Her work can be monumental or intimate in scale and combines multiple mediums, including oil, acrylic, and lacquer. Eichwald rejects preciousness, and her process involves exposing works to the elements, where they accumulate dirt and wear. In her sculptures small bits of found materials such as food scraps, metal filings and rubbish are frequently suspended in resin-filled plastic gloves and bags. In both her paintings and sculptures, Eichwaldâ€™s works suggest layers of private narrative that intentionally elude explanation and form a visceral record of their creation.
