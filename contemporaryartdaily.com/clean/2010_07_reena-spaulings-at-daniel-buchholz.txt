Reena Spaulings presents five small paintings based on a postcard sent to New York from Michael Krebber. An iconic image of the city of Cologne, featuring the Dom cathedral, is rendered three times in a pointillist style. Two of these landscapes is paired with an abstract image in the same postcard format, making two diptychs. The sound of a barking dog evokes both home security and meditative promenades along the Rhine.
