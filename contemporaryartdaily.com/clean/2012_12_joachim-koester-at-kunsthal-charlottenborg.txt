Charlottenborg is proud to present a solo exhibition by Joachim Koester, one of the most significant Danish artists of his generation. The exhibition is the artist’s largest and most comprehensive project to date in his home country, and is a survey of his works from 2005 to 2012. The project features film, photography and installation, and includes many pieces that demonstrate his interest in alternative communities and altered states – and in the lost or suppressed histories of occult and esoteric practices.
Koester’s exhibition, entitled If One Thing Moves, Everything Moves, features a dramatic staging that has been conceived in collaboration with the artist. The installation takes the form of a darkened and immersive environment that includes a number of large wooden structures, transforming the grand gallery spaces in Charlottenborg’s south wing. The result has a strong experiential character, and one which emphasises the artist’s preoccupation with the body and performance – and with the hidden knowledge that might reside in the body.
Born in Copenhagen in 1962, Koester is a graduate of the Royal Danish Academy of Art and is based in Copenhagen. The artist’s recent and forthcoming solo exhibitions include: Kestnergesellschaft, Hannover (2010); The Power Plant, Toronto (2010); Museo Tamayo, Mexico City (2010); IAC Villeurbanne / Rhône-Alpes; (December 2011), MIT List Visual Art Center, Boston (2012); and SMAK, Ghent (opening December 2012). His recent group exhibitions include: Reality Check, Statens Museum for Kunst, Copenhagen (2008); Altermodern, Tate Britain, London (2009); and Animism, MuHKA, Antwerp (2010) and touring venues.
