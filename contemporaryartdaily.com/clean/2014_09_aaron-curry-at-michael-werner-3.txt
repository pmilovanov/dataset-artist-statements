Michael Werner Gallery, London, is pleased to present an exhibition of new paintings by Los Angeles-based artist Aaron Curry. This is the artist’s first exhibition devoted to paintings, representing a new direction in his work.
A modern day mash-up of classical and kitsch has long been the conceptual hallmark of Aaron Curry’s diverse practice. Drawing on late-20th century modernism, science fiction, comic book illustration and California street style, Curry’s complex, intensely colored sculptures slyly upended received notions of abstraction, figuration and the role of sculpture as form-in-space. His conflation of sculpted form with printed and painted surfaces confused formal distinctions of two- and three-dimensional opticality, mass and volume. Curry’s new, large-scale paintings on canvas, shown here for the first time, are a departure from the artist’s sculptural practice and represent an entirely new direction in his work. Strikingly illusionistic renderings of grotesque figures and heads, painted in savagely intense hues, call upon a rich array of visual associations high and low: Yves Tanguy and Robert Williams, Japanese “ghost heads”, Roberto Matta and the checked-out illustrations of Juxtapoz, Juan Gris and Garbage Pail Kids. Curry’s new paintings further complicate the visual and metaphoric potential of the artist’s pop-infused abstraction, blurring the line between contemporary psychedelia and classic surrealism.
