Absorption of environment defines Nora Schultz’s art works from their commencement.
In this case, the artist renders systems such as teeth and the gallery interiors in to a film, made by a flying robot camera. Based on the resulted imagery of the film, Schultz creates sculptures which refer to what should have been the ‘props’ for the film. The sculptures are made of found objects pulled from the hardware store and local constructionsites.
The installation transforms these objects once again; in the gallery, her work slayer them selves and each other, fully taking advantage of three dimensions, constantly redefining their parts in relation to one another. Language then intrudes: in the ‘film posters’, Schultz’s titling, the ephemera (posters, texts) she releases alongside the exhibition, and the words written on the things themselves, subject them to external references, altering their meaning ever further.
And then, there is the work throwing everything into new dimension: the ‘exhibition’. In this way, the artist suggests an art that is a predicament, a shifty, evasive, and radically unsettled state for a group of transitory objects and ideas. This work is ‘finished’ when it is shown, but only at that moment, in that place; everything will finish again and again.
