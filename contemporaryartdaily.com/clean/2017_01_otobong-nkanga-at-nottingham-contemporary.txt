Huge tapestries, performances, drawings and installations trace all kinds of different botanical and geological histories in Otobong Nkanga’s work. This is the Antwerp-based Nigerian artist’s first solo show in this country.
The exhibition is made up of two site-specific installations. One, a new commission, is a constellation of museum display cases, a vast wall drawing and a large two-part tapestry. Next door Nkanga has created a new version of her installation Taste of a Stone, which brings the natural world into the gallery to create a landscape of boulders, pebbles, trees and other plants. This environment for contemplation is inhabited by local storytellers, musicians and dancers, as well as visitors. All are invited to share memories and moods.
Otobong Nkangas exhibition is co-produced by Nottingham Contemporary and Kunsthal Aarhus.
