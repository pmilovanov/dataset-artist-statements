What Pipeline is happy to present Empires &amp; Enclaves, a selection of paintings and sculptures by Matthew Zivich. Works include the Architectural Model sculptures from the late 1980s and the caulk painting series, Leviathans, from 2000-2009.
The five architectural models date from approximately 1987 to 1989 and appear to be typical examples of preliminary, scale-model buildings. Included are representations of iconic modern structures such as Mies van der Rohes 860 Lake Shore Drive and Phillip Johnsons Glass House; and an anonymous government building from Munich during the Third Reich. Fictitious structures include a cenotaph for Mussolini made for an imaginary competition sponsored by the city of Milan, Italy celebrating the 50th anniversary of Il Duces death; and finally, Enclaves is an urban depiction initially inspired by the bombardment of Sarajevo during the breakup of Yugoslavia.
The caulk paintings in the Leviathan series represent warships that were instrumental as precursors to revolution or invasion, created using a non-traditional medium such as household caulk. Included in this series are Untitled (Potemkin), Untitled (Aurora), Untitled (Maine), and Untitled (Mystery Sub). Matthew Zivich
