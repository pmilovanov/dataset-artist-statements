EL: You know the Orsay conservators are restoring l’Atelier right now and Jeanne Duval is resurfacing to the top?? Apparition, réapparition de Jeanne! So now they don’t know what to do, leave her there or not.
VD: The picture of Jeanne Duval was one of the first paintings I ever copied, in summer art school when I was 16. The way the curtain and the dress alternate like ocean waves is so beautiful, and the way her foot and the fan come out of the waves are like fetishes.
