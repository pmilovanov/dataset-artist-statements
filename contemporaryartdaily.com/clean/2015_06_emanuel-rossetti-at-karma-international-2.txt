Twelve carpeted modules float from the wall, filling up the left side of the gallery in a ragged alignment, hiding a line of loudspeakers.
A recurring sound composition is distributed through the space in an up and down scrolling motion. The fade-out and the following silence end in a loop, implying a duration which should be applied to the act of spectation.
Installed as a title, a flickering lamp found its way indoors. It serves as a permanent announcement, pointing towards the exit whilst spilling its disrupted radiation.
On the right side of the gallery, a just entered torus is paused on a white vinyl sheet.
