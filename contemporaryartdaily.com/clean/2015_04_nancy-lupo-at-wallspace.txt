I have sketched a bone whose natural length has been increased three times and whose thickness has been multiplied until, for a correspondingly large animal, it would perform the same function that the small bone performs for its small animal.
The pressure exerted by a jaw is considerable. These bones satisfy the natural urge to chew.
Unlike most other foods that prioritize taste and texture, this was engineered to maximize nutrition.
Even if it seems arbitrary it helped me to understand that it is the body that controls the mind, the invisible world within the visible.
The pocket park has never looked better; it received a full makeover with new landscaping and the installation of new fitness equipment. The concrete benches formerly located in the park were removed from the site and have been recycled.
