Riding attempts with fatal outcome
Man on
&gt;&gt; Lion – Duration ca. 2 seconds
&gt;&gt; Ostrich – throws man off at high speed. Man suffers a few small abrasions; resulting in infection with bird-flu virus &gt; immune system collapses.
&gt;&gt; Stag – runs like lightning through the woods &gt; man succeeds in holding on to the antlers and sitting more or less upright &gt; stag runs under a branch, which hits human exactly in the head.
Variation: Stag lowers head at high speed and then comes to a sudden halt. Reciprocal penetration of man and antlers.
