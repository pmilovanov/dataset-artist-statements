“… this is your captain and we are going down, we are all going down, together…”
– Laurie Anderson
Where we once relied on instinctual forms of heightened awareness, as human beings we now depend largely upon artificial triggers and systems of warning to keep ourselves comfortably safe. However, even these signals are often rendered ineffectual, a result of the normality of contemporary living. Safety protocol, and simple rules and regulations become standardized; synonymous with the chirp of birds or the drone of human industry.
Emergency Measures includes a group of artworks that inhabit a space between positions of presence and absence, certainty and doubt, and anxiety and ease. They explore a range of ways in which forms of awareness can be triggered. Some are abstract, some metaphorical and others more literally related to the ways that a rupture in daily life can be either delineated or avoided.
