Shane Campbell Gallery is pleased to announce the exhibition Rapport Vroom by Torey Thornton, at the galleryâ€™s Lincoln Park location.
These 39 paintings on paper hugging the architecture, mirroring this architecture, mirroring self. Theres no running from reflection.
-Torey Thornton
In a buildin tall with a stone wall around theres a rubber room
When a man sees things and hears sounds thats not there
Hes headed for the rubber room
Illusions in a twisted mind to save from self-destruction hmm its the rubber room
Where a man can run into the wall till his strength makes him fall and lie still
And wait for help in the rubber room
From his blurry vision of doom a psycho in the rubber room
The man in the room right next to mine screams a womans name hits the wall in vain
Hes in the rubber room
I hear footsteps poundin on the floor God I hope they dont stop at my door
Hmm Im in the rubber room
Now theyve come to get me but they find
Im a screamin pretty words tryin to make em rhyme
Im n the rubber room hmm a psycho Im in the rubber room hmm
 Porter Wagner, Rubber Room
