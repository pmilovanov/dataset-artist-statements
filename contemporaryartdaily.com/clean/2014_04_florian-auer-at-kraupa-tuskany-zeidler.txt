Blue Prints conceives the exhibition space as a plane of colliding dimensions. Angles, shadows, interfaces, liquid camouflage, and perspectives cast the physical environment into a scenario that arouses the very act of recognizing. A throw of dice opens up a virtual arena with its own chances. Due to its purposeful use of blank space and careful placement of 3-dimensional ideas Blue Prints proposes a concept of hyperreality allowing multiple non-linear readings of reflexion. Ideas of virtual renders on their way to perform and mediate congealed in time; a space turning into a frozen spectacle.
