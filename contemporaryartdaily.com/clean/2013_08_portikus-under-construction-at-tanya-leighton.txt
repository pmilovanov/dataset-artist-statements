Portikus Under Construction finds its center around Helke Bayrles ongoing video project of the same name. Bayrle — who lives and works in Frankfurt — has been faithfully documenting each exhibition at Portikus since 1992. Her videos, now numbering 137 and steadily climbing, are unique in their short duration and noticeable intimacy. These short videos picture artists in the days and hours leading up to the opening of their exhibition — unpacking their works, interacting with curators and art handlers, and ultimately celebrating their efforts at the shows opening. Seen collectively, these portraits begin to describe the ongoing mission of Portikus and its importance not only as a progressive exhibition venue, but also as a hub of interaction between students, curators, artists, and the public.
Bayrles videos are accompanied by a selection of artworks by John Ahearn, Thomas Bayrle, On Kawara, Allan McCollum, and Thomas Schütte, as well as ephemera from the archives of Portikus, friends, and former staff members.
