Georgia Sagri Ads for Air gives a first overview of the artistâ€™s video works produced between 2007 and 2010 situated at a moment of consolidating mass digitization and social media infancy. These animations, motion graphics, filmic schizo-portraits and vignettes of a New York at the end of the Bush era and the onset of the financial meltdown have since lived a double-life as personal uploads and public archival copies in the forked paths of some world wide web. For this exhibition Sagri has scored these pieces into a screenscape, placed within a vacant office at the city limits of Zurich.
