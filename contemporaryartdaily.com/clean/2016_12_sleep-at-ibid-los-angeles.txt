Ibid Gallerys presents Sleep, curated by Paolo Colombo from September 25 – December 17, 2016 in the largest of the three galleries in its newly opened location in Downtown Los Angeles.
The title of this show touches on a mood, rather than on an abstract concept of sleep: the presentation includes a number of works that illustrate the dimension of dreaming, of surrender, and of submission to states of trance and slumber.
In Greek mythology Hypnos (Sleep) is the brother of Thanatos (Death) and the son of Nyx (the Night) and Erebus (Darkness). He lives by the river Lethe, source of forgetfulness. His children include Morpheus (Shape: the Inducer of Dreams in human form) Phobetor (Fear: the Inducer of Dreams in animal form) and Phantasos (Imagination: Inducer of Prophetic Dreams)—all begotten with Pasithea, goddess of relaxation and hallucinations.
As Hypnos inhabits half of our lives, it seems appropriate that an exhibition be dedicated to its influence, addressing our necessary abandonment to night, fatigue and oblivion. The works on show
will allude to an extended family of Hypnos, from the inducer of letting-go to the memory of languor: from the darkness of night to the oblivion of death.
This exhibition includes a tapestry by Ed Ruscha, Industrial Strength Sleep, produced in 2006 with The Fabric Workshop and Museum in Philadelphia; works on paper by Jānis Avoti7!, Robert Gober, Jorge Macchi, Paul Thek, Rosemarie Trockel, and a paper stack work by Felix Gonzalez-Torres.
A special section of the show is dedicated to manuscripts by three American poets: Andrea Applebee; Mc Arthur Fellow A.E. Stallings; and G.F. Zaimis. This section is a homage to the personification of sleep in the classical world through three poets that have established Greece as their residence.
Sleep, curated by Paolo Colombo, is the first of a series of exhibitions hosted by guest curators that Ibid Gallery will present in its space.
