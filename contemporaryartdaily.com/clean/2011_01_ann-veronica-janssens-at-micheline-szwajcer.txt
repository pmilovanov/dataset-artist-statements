Ann Veronica Janssens artistic practice could be defined as an exploratory journey into the sensory experience of reality. Using different devices – installations, projections, immersive environments, urban interventions, sculptures –, she invites the viewer to cross the threshold into a new sensory space, on the borderline of dizziness and bedazzlement. In a register inspired by cognitive processes, her works tend toward a certain minimalism, underscoring the fleeting, ephemeral or fragile character of what she is proposing. Spatialization and distribution of light, radiant colour, and translucent or reflective surfaces all serve to reveal the instability of our perception of time and space. Properties of matter (gloss, lightness, transparency, fluidity) and physical phenomena (reflection, refraction, perspective, balance, waves) are rigorously investigated for their ability to destabilize the very concept of materiality.
