The works of Berlin artist Nairy Baghramian (b. Isfahan, 1971) typically address the conditions of their own making, their physical and extended contexts and a nexus of referential resonances in modern and contemporary sculpture. Among the questions she highlights are the physical and conceptual space of sculpture in relation to monumentality, the base or pedestal, functionality, as well as site specificity or the architecture of which it forms part.
Hand Me Down presents a group of works produced expressly for this exhibition. The title alludes to gifted second hand clothes as a metaphor of the contradictory legacy of minimalism, which assumes contemporary sculpture as recipient of a pattern of production that reduces the use of materials to the most essential formats, dimensions and processes. In response, Baghramian shows in this exhibition a series of sculptures that have been separated into abstracted, constituent parts: here the cutouts, hollow shell, there the denuded skeleton sketched as intersecting steel lines and elsewhere the enlarged hanging organs. The architecture of the Museo Tamayo acts as both host and foil, its visitors the muses.
