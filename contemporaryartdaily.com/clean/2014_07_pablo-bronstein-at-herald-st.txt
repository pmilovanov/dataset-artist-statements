For Pablo Bronsteinâ€™s fourth show at Herald St the artist has created a completely new interior within the existing gallery structure. The design of the new galleries is purpose built to house a series of new framed drawings, a centrally positioned, velvet lined space will be flanked by two circular rooms that will each act as frames for a large scale panoramic drawing.
