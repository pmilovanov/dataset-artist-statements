In Swiss artist Marta Riniker-Radich’s exhibition at Kunsthaus Glarus (b. 1982 in Bern, lives and works in Frankfurt am Main and Geneva), the medium of drawing encounters installative and text-based works. Vibrantly colored drawings depict fictional places out of time or altered and oddly familiar things with highly detailed scientific precision. Places alternating between comfort and control – single-family homes, entryways, facades, fluffy interiors – and objects such as safety locks, decorated cupcakes, or painted eggs (exaggeratedly) illustrate, abstract, and comment on the world around us. The works of Marta-Riniker Radich are based on research into the history of (and stakeholders in de facto), historical, social and economic structures. Serving as the point of departure for We, on the Other Hand, Can Do Everything Remotely are men’s communities and “groupings” from the world of work and recreation. The exhibition brings together a selection of drawings, produced in the last ten years, with new works created for the Kunsthaus Glarus. In the physical exhibition space in Glarus, sculptural objects connote functional use and architectural interventions become the link between fictional and real spaces.
