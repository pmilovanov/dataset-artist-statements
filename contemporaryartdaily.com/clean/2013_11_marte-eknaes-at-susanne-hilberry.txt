Susanne Hilberry Gallery is pleased to announce a solo exhibition of new work by Marte Eknæs. The exhibition will open with a reception for the artist Friday 4 October from 6 to 8 pm. Eknæss work draws from our contemporary environment, often borrowing from the common aspects of architecture and interior. She re-thinks and re-mixes, presents us with objects that are both of formal interest and also question the way we interact with and notice our surroundings.
The shows title, Perpendicular Picture, not only refers to specific works in the show, but also suggests a broader reading of the exhibition as an image, the formal relationships between individual works as well as a new context for familiar materials and devices. The exhibition will include sculptures, models, “perpendicular pictures” and works on paper, which Eknæs playfully gives equal measure. The work explores the spectrum of our environment. A drawing may be a plan, representation or documentation. Materials are at once removed from their ordinary use and reapplied in analogous or comparative ways, creating new formal relationships and further consideration.
Eknæss duplitecture models are both interpretations and critical takes of buildings by the famous architects who dominate global trends in architecture (in this exhibition, Zaha Hadid and Frank Gehry). She creates models for a repurposed version, reinterprets the facade/structure making use of mundane and sometimes comical materials, and presents us with a new model that raises sociological and economical concern. Simultaneously, Eknæs deals with hidden utilitarian and unglamorous aspects. The trashcan is presented as a theme in both sculpture and work on paper. And the materials utilized for both art object and traditional support (pedestal, frame, etc.) stem from her interest in common, industrial sources, but are used in various forms, finishes and applications, reiterating exploration over repetition.
