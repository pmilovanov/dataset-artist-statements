In his multi-media practice Ben Schumacher explores the complex interaction between physical presence and biographical representation. As part of his first institutional exhibition in Germany, the artist has transformed the Remise into a temporary cheese storage. A dilapidated shelving system provides space for both heavy wheels of cheese and a frieze of carved wooden objects representing the seven sacraments of the Catholic Church. The thin cables binding these objects together simulate a link between the local tradition and craft of cheese production and the demands of global connectivity. The installation also includes a series of seven cheese-colored paintings dealing with initiation, healing, and service.
Ben Schumacher (*1985 in Kitchener, Canada) lives in Berlin and New York. He has shown his work in exhibitions at the Biennale de Montréal, 2016, the 13th Fellbach Triennial of Small-scale Sculpture, 2016, the Museum of Contemporary Art Lyon, 2014 and the Sculpture Center, New York, 2011. Following his exhibition at Kunstverein Braunschweig, Schumacher will take part in group exhibitions at ZKM Karlsruhe and the Kunsthalle Zürich in 2017.
