Monika Sprüth and Philomene Magers are delighted to present Louise Lawlers first solo exhibition in their new gallery space in Berlin after having shown her work many times since 1987. The photographs shown in the exhibition were taken in auction houses and homes, most notably Yves Saint Laurent‘s apartment in Paris.
Lawler (b. 1947 in Bronxville, New York) has exhibited widely in institutions throughout Europe and North America including the Centre Pompidou, Paris; Kunstmuseum Basel; Tate Modern, London; Wexner Center for the Arts, Columbus; Guggenheim Museum, New York; Museum of Modern Art, New York. She lives and works in New York.
