Sterling Ruby (b. 1972 Germany, lives and works in Los Angeles, U.S.A.) is a multidisciplinary artist who became renowned for his large glassy ceramic sculptures and abstract paintings. His paintings are reminiscent of dark interpretations of the Colour Field Paintings from the sixties. His work can as well refer to classic architecture and modern Minimalism, but also to marginality, vandalism and power structures. His exceptional use of materials and his ability to develop a particularly powerful visual language makes Sterling Ruby one of the most important artists of the beginning of the twenty-first century. At the museum Dhondt-Dhaenens, Sterling Ruby creates a complete project for the large patio and the garden.
