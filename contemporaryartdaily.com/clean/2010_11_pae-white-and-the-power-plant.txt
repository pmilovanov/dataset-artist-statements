‘Pae White: Material Mutters’ is an exhibition that features a newly commissioned monumental tapestry by Los Angeles-based artist Pae White. This commission, Sea Beast, will be the centrepiece of this survey, which contextualizes her new work with many of her past tapestries of epic scale, as well as video animations and works on paper.
Pae White began creating massive tapestries in 2004, ambitious undertakings that use heavily digitally manipulated photos of crumpled aluminum foil, plumes of smoke and dynamic image collages of collected scraps of image, pattern, colour, and text as their content. White’s ambitious commission for The Power Plant is a tapestry, a large-scale image of a found macramé wall hanging. The commission signals a new visual direction in her work while representing her continued practice of blurring materials and appropriating scraps and ephemera.
White is an internationally established figure in contemporary art who revels in the rapport between art, design, the applied arts, and architecture, while questioning the traditional and often nebulous boundaries between them. White’s exhilarating and experimental oeuvre has continued to evolve in its roaming across different material forms and contexts with a sense of exuberant abandon.
‘Pae White: Material Mutters’ will be accompanied by an artist’s catalogue and features texts by curator of the exhibition and Director of The Power Plant Gregory Burke, Susan Emerling and Oliver Zybok.
