In collaboration with Bywater Bros. Editions
Lou Ford isnt much of a people person. He prefers things. The things he likes the most are things that mess with his mind. This exhibition, which bears his name, includes a number of objects hes admired over the years most of the stuff on display would be considered art, but hes also added a few things that most people would call “trash”.
This exhibition features editions published by Bywater Bros. Editions together with selected works from Roddy Buchanan, Jos de Gruyter &amp; Harald Thys, Jens Haaning, Adam McEwen, Sophie Nys, Jack Pierson, Richard Prince, Dahn Vo, Johannes Wohnseifer, Gil Hibben Studios, Sweet Tango Apples® and Desert Essence Organics®. The exhibition will also feature a number of vintage pinball machines designed by the late American artist Jerry Kelley.
