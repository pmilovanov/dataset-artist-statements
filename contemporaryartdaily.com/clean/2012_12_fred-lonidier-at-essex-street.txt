This is Fred Lonidiers first solo exhibition in New York since one took place at the Whitney Museum of American Art in 1977.
The exhibition will survey several bodies of work, the earliest made in 1973.
Four over four decades Lonidier has dedicated his work as an artist, critic and professor to conveying social issues. Principally working with photographic objects, Lonidier conveys the semiotics of labor, production, power and protest. His works explicitly foreground how they were made, who made them, at what cost and upon what stakes.
Lonidiers most frequent site of exhibition has been in Union Halls, Labor Centers and Universities.
His work has recently been included in Under the Big Black Sun: California Art 1974 1981, curated by Paul Schimmel at MOCA, Los Angeles in 2011; State of Mind: New California Art Circa 1970 at the Orange County Museum of Art, Newport Beach in 2011 and Strange Interlude, curated by Egija Inzule at Palais de Tokyo, Paris in 2012.
Significant surveys of his work were held at Cardwell Jimmerson Contemporary Art, Culver City and at Silberkuppe, Berlin both in 2011. These exhibitions were reviewed by Artforum, Texte Zur Kunst and Frieze Magazines.
