Campoli Presti is pleased to present Jutta Koether’s second solo exhibition at the gallery. The exhibition comprises one large painting and a set of five plank-canvases composing one work.
The plank-canvas idea was developed in relation to lecture-performances / acts and further explored as Mad Garland complex as part of the Grand Openings: Return of the Blog performance piece. For this set of black works the figure of the garland partially leaves the canvas and becomes its own canvas. It determines the shape of the canvas instead of being an element in it.
The garland also relates to the idea of ongoing undetermined spaces and Koether’s interest in notions of speculative realism, that is the way we try to occupy and grasp the reality of virtual space, a fantasy space, that we inhabit and that inhabits us.
The act of painting as performance is a theme treated in both of the black pieces for this present exhibition. The origin of the garland as a decorative element that both can literally hold a space but is at the same time a fleeting, moveable entity has been visualized in roman wall paintings depicting Dionysian rites, dance, music and performance on various levels.
Koether has recently presented a solo exhibition at Moderna Museet in Stockholm. Past solo exhibitions include JXXXA Leibhaftige Malerei at Bergen Kunsthall, Norway, Änderungen aller Art at Kunsthalle Bern and Fantasia Colonia at Kölnischer Kunstverein, Cologne. Her work is part of the permanent collections of MoMA; Musée d’Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris; Nationalgalerie, Berlin; Kunsthalle Bern and MOCA, Los Angeles.
