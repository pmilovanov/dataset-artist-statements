Ratio 3 is pleased to present Capital Zero, new work by Jonathan Runcio, on view from March 20 to April 25, 2009.
Jonathan Runcio will present a series of new paintings created using simple shapes, re-arranging them, and allowing the colors, such as the print-standard CMYK palette, to overlap and blend, creating new hues. Methodical in their production, the paintings offer a complex optical dialogue as he plays with a combination of colors, positive, and negative forms. In addition to the paintings, Runcio will also show new sculptures. Made of acrylic and steel and abstract in form, the sculptures hint at the representation of familiar objects. By employing a structured and restrained approach to materials and color, Runcios installation conveys a refined yet intense chromatic experience.
Jonathan Runcio was born in 1977 in Montreal, Canada. He graduated with a BFA in painting from the California College of Arts &amp; Crafts in 1999. He has had solo exhibitions at Art LA (2008) and Ratio 3 (2006 &amp; 2004), and will be participating in Portugal Arte 09, Lisbon. In 2005 he founded Woodward Flats, producing print editions for artists such as Ara Peterson, Isaac Lin and Tauba Auerbach. Runcio currently lives and works in San Francisco. This is his third solo exhibition with Ratio 3.
