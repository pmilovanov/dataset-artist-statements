MACRO presents Streets of Rome and Other Stories, the first large solo-exhibition in an Italian public museum dedicated to Jimmie Durham, celebrating the long career of one of the world’s most recognized and established artists, characterized by a critical and political commitment to the advocacy of minorities’ rights.
The exhibition was created to gather the most significant pieces of work from the last ten years, and to offer the public a new and transversal view of the artist’s formal and critical poetic universe, in which objects and materials regain their primitive and pre-verbal form and become symbols of a new cosmogony of the boundary between nature, technology and civility.
Moving from reflection on the particular relationship with Rome – where Durham lived for five years, from 2007 to 2012 – and on the relevance of the role that the Capital has held in recent productions, the show brings together the most important works that the artist has created in the city and for the city, in which it is evident that the atmosphere, the streets and the people have been an inspiration and constant stimulus for Durham’s research.
The exhibition installed in the Sala Bianca will allow visitors to rediscover, among others, previous interventions for his exhibitions at RAM radioartemobile, Fondazione VOLUME! and Edicola Notte, along with videos from the artist’s personal archive.
The exhibition will also include a large work conceived especially for the spaces of MACRO, an ideal culmination of Durham’s Roman experience and a point of connection for his future research and development.
