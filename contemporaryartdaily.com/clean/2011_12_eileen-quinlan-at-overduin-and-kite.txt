Overduin and Kite is pleased to present Constant Comment, the gallery’s second exhibition with New York-based artist Eileen Quinlan.
For this exhibition, Quinlan has created new works in which representational images or tabletop arrangements of objects are altered, obscured or abstracted through physical or chemical means in the photographic process. The chemical interventions often appear as tears, folds, or an unraveling or loosening of the fabric of the image. These pieces examine the gestural mark versus the chemical stain, engaging each possibility without favor. Quinlan presents these works along side recycled images from her earliest photographs: a snapshot of the back of a friend wearing the artist’s blouse, a turreted stone building from her hometown, and a self-portrait taken from a reflection in a pond. By reintroducing these images from her past, Quinlan eschews an idea of linear progression in the work emphasizing the structure of an ensemble of images.
These bodies of work engage each other in a way that addresses questions of photographic expressivity in representational versus abstract compositions. Images of bow ties and bras insert ideas of gender, authorship, and subjectivity. Folk craft and ideas of the handmade object are considered in a group of images of a quilt. In other works, images of ferns recall photograms and some of photography’s earliest experiments. With these photographs and within her practice in general, Quinlan has developed a language that moves fluidly between physical and more purely chemical processes; one that continues to question the means and meaning of image production.
Eileen Quinlan lives and works in New York. Recent solo exhibitions include Miguel Abreu in New York and Sutton Lane in Paris in 2010, and The Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston in 2009. Quinlan’s work was also included in “All of this and nothing” at the Hammer Museum in Los Angeles earlier this year.
