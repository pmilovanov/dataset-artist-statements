In their debut at the gallery, Nik and Dan have continued to dynamically hedge their positions with a new body of sculpture and installation. Following protocol, they have more or less performed the following assessments: Identified assets and identified which are most critical, identified, characterized and assessed threats, assessed the vulnerability of critical assets to specific threats, and then determined the risk to those assets.
The array of defensive solutions they exhibit range in tactic from high energy density figurative painting, customized flood prevention, to a system of charitable body movements.
Ideally, the predetermined risks to the exhibitionâ€™s success will have been effectively managed, explicitly address uncertainty and assumptions, create value- (The gain should exceed the pain), and be capable of continual improvement and reassessment.
