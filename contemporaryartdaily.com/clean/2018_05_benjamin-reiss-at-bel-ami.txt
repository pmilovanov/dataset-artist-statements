Benjamin Reisss Package Factory (Natural Marriage of Natural Resources) (2016-2018) probes at the limits of understanding, the unconscious, and the outsourcing of agency via the card-backed blister package, used for selling batteries, toys, chapstick, pens, and a great many other quotidian items.
The work is presented alongside research notes and drawings made during its production, and a series of satellite works.
This exhibition is accompanied by A Lovers Guide to the Package Factory by Ana Iwataki, a booklet published with a selection of Notes for Package Factory.
