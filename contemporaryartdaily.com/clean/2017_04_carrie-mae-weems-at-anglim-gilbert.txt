Anglim Gilbert Gallery is pleased to present a film program of four works by Carrie Mae Weems.
In the screening gallery of Minnesota Street Project, Weems’ recent films, “Surveillance (2016), “Cornered” (2016), “The Madding Crowd” (2017), and ”People of a Darker Hue” (2016), will be shown in sequence ongoing during exhibition hours.
Carrie Mae Weem’s practice invites contemplation of race, gender and class through performance, photography and video. Using only found footage “The Madding Crowd” takes its lead from Thomas Hardy’s novel (Far from the Madding Crowd) and in similarity to, stresses themes of disrupted connection to one’s place, one’s land and one’s community. Weems positions herself both behind the camera and in its lens exacting a keen gaze on her subject while making clear her empathy and identification with what she observes. All four films serve as stark documentation of the consequences communities face when they are decimated by societal unease, corruption and intolerance.
For over 35 years, Carrie Mae Weems has worked with photography, film and video, offering creative insight into issues of society and identity. Through written and narrated text, performance and collaboration, she has broadened possibilities for film and photographic media, evolving a new artistic forum for the subjects of race, class and gender. A MacArthur Foundation Fellow, she has received an honorary doctorate from the School of the Visual Arts and exhibited her work internationally. A retrospective exhibition of her work, Carrie Mae Weems: Three Decades of Film and Video, was presented at the Guggenheim Museum in 2014.
