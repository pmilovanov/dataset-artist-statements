James Fuentes is pleased to announce ‘Forget About the Sweetbreads’, curated by artist Joanne Greenbaum and associate director of the gallery Adrianne Rubenstein.
The motive for this exhibition was a conversation that happened nearly a year ago, which we wanted to extend by engaging in a curatorial project. Our mutual interest in ceramic sculpture and the way it activates traditional yet internal sensibilities helped to inform our choices. We looked at the work of many artists of different generations, and came to think of them as part of a continuum. Barath, Cahn, Gronemeyer, Mackler, Messager, Prangenberg, and Saulson each represent a facet of our inquiry. Rather than holding court to an overlying theme, their practices are decidedly different yet visionary.
