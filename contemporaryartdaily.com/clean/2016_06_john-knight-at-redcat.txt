REDCAT (Roy and Edna Disney CalArts Theater) was carved out of the parking structure of the Walt Disney Concert Hall (home of L.A. Philharmonic), and opened in 2003 as CalArts downtown venue for contemporary arts. The Gallery at REDCAT was itself an addition to the original plan, which initially only included a multi-purpose performing arts center. Now, over a decade later, the neighborhood is transformed into the highly developed cultural corridor of downtown Los Angeles, prompting revived relations between space, architecture, contemporary arts and real estate.
Artist John Knights biography states that he lives in Los Angeles and works in-situ. Since the late 1960s his work has been grounded in an address of site, particularly articulating the ideological and architectural parameters of the museum, gallery and public sphere. In this regard, his work can be seen to extend from the critical address of spatial concerns raised by Minimalism, while taking on diverse forms of intervention through publications, commodities, graphics and architecture. Through such activation and occupation of material, discursive and economic conditions, Knight interrogates the operations of power within art, design and institutionalism.
