Hello hello my Hitlir, are you sleeping? I’m coming with the boat in 30 minutes.
A very sweet man gave me a stamp to get in. Isnt that good, old potatoe?
Hhhhhh lol, I love it!
Darling youre my apricot, my chocolate, my strawberry, my little bunny.
Hi Danger, I’m out of here. Whats with Mr. Electric?
Will you come in 300 hours?
Come on, switch on the light or are you a ghost?
She’s a dirty woman and she’s bad too.
A farm egg, a donkey mare.
When she was still married, she would often give me money.
She has three children, they’re being cared for in a house in Germany.
I told you before, its all mighty strong here, the good and the bad alike.
No, no way Im going into the house of a woman who practices magic.
I feel quite jittery, all hot inside. The others arent well either. Its all her doing!
It all comes from her. I was in her house this morning… I dont know, what has she done?
I dont want you to turn it into a soft cheese!
