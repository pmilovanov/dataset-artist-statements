Imi Knoebel: Knife Cuts Part 2, is the latest in a series of temporary exhibitions at the Dan Flavin Art Institute that has included works by Louise Bourgeois (1989), Andy Warhol (1987 and 1992), Fred Sandback (2004—2006), and John Chamberlain (2007). The show comprises a selection of some 35 of the 80 parts that make up the work Untitled (1977) which consists of collages made from paper cutouts vibrantly colored in oils and acrylics. Untitled (1977) was first shown in 1977 at Heiner Friedrich Galerie in Cologne, and a different selection of its parts was shown last year at Flavin Institute in the exhibition Imi Knoebel: Knife Cuts Part 1, from May 22-December 2008.
Imi Knoebel
Imi Knoebel was born in Dessau, Germany, in 1940. He was a student of Joseph Beuys at the Kunstakademie Düsseldorf from 1964 to 1971. His first exhibition, IMI + IMI, with Imi Giese, a fellow student of Beuys, was held in Copenhagen, in 1968. Knoebel has since exhibited his works in Documentas 5 (1972), 6 (1977), 7 (1982), and 8 (1987), and at Sonsbeek 71. In 1987 Knoebel oversaw an installation of his own work, as well as that of Beuys and Blinky Palermo, for the inaugural exhibitions at Dias galleries on West 22nd Street in New York City. A retrospective of his work traveled, in 1996—97, throughout Europe, including such venues as Haus der Kunst, Munich; Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam; and Institut Valencià dArt Modern, Centre Julio González, Valencia. He will have a major retrospective in summer 2009 at the Hamburger Bahnhof and the Neue Nationalgalerie in Berlin. His monumental cycle, 24 Colors—for Blinky (1977) is currently on view at Dia:Beacon. He lives and works in Düsseldorf.
