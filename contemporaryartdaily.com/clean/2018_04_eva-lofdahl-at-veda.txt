Veda is pleased to announce a solo exhibition by Eva Löfdahl titled, The Earth As We Know It. Löfdah’s subtly baffling works arrive whole without explanation and generate a casual intensity that deepens with time.
In the front gallery, Löfdahl presents a receding landscape. Platforms of foam extending from street level are supported by long bamboo poles reaching up from the floor of the sunken gallery. The scene is flanked on the left by a row of sweeping broom heads. On the ground below rests group of bright and lumpy pillows. A series of intimately scaled drawings hang in the back gallery; Löfdahl made each work by holding an ink-soaked string over paper and letting it mark a path.
