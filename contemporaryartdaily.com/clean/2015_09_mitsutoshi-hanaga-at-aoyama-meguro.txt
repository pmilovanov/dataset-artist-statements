Aoyama Meguro is pleased to announce the introduction of work by Mitsutoshi Hanaga (1933-1999) for the second time since last year’s Art Fair Tokyo.
Most notable for his photographic documentations of Hi-Red Center (Jiro Takamatsu, Genpei Akasegawa, Natsuyuki Nakanishi), Tetsumi Kudo, Ushio Shinohara, Akaji Maro (Dairakudakan) and many others, Hanaga’s work has been attracting attention in recent years. This exhibition will mainly center on Hanaga’s photographic records of outdoor performances by avant-garde artists.
The statement below is cited from Mitsutoshi Hanaga’s official website.
Throughout his life, Mitsutoshi Hanaga had always worked closely with the creators on-site, and had become the firsthand witness of artistic production. Many of his legendary photographs are considered today as a valuable work, and they have been shown in numerous museums. This exhibition will showcase over 200 photographs, including many unpublished prints, and it will again serve as an opportunity to investigate its content.
