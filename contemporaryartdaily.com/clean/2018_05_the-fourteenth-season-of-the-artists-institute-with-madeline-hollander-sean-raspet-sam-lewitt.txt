This spring, the Artist’s Institute’s program brings us closer to the surprising, unstable, and powerful capacities of matter. In the physical sciences and economics, we sometimes call this kind of work energetics―the study of the way that energy flows through a system. For the art field, an emphasis on energetics reorients aesthetics to material expression, sometimes a material expression that exceeds that of the artist’s own imagination or will. Through artworks, talks, and other events this spring, the Institute’s fellows are engaging with energy as an animating force. Energy has the capacity to synthesize molecules. Energy heats up a room.
…make something which experiences, reacts to its environment, changes, is nonstable…
…make something indeterminate, which always looks different, the shape of which cannot be predicted precisely…
…make something which cannot “perform” without the assistance of its environment…
…make something which reacts to light and temperature changes, is subject to air currents and depends, in its functioning, on the forces of gravity…
…make something which the “spectator” handles, with which he plays and thus animates…
…make something which lives in time and makes the “spectator” experience time…
…articulate something Natural…
Hans Haacke, Cologne, January 1965
