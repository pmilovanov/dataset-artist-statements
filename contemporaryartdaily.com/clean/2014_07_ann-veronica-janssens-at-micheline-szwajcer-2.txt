“Simple shapes in plaster are mounted to the walls. They are made following the traditional technique of wall plastering. White, matt and smooth as they are, their surfaces catch the eye before letting it perceive the space in total. They appear neither as sculpture nor painting, but as the embodiment of a luminous moment. I call them ‘cold constellations’. Other dark and shiny shapes emerge in the installation: a black bar made of glass, like frozen ink, a heap of glitters and a transparent glass plate with an engraved concave lens.”
