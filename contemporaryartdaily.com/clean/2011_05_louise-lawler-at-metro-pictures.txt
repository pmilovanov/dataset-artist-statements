Louise Lawler has taken photographs of art in museums, galleries, private homes, and auction houses and altered them to conform to the proportions of the gallerys walls. The distorted photographs are affixed to the center of the walls, one wall per image.
Louise Lawler has had one-person exhibitions at the Wexner Center for the Arts, Columbus, Ohio (2006); Dia:Beacon, Beacon, New York (2005); the Museum f√ºr Gegenwartskunst, Basel (2004); Portikus, Frankfurt (2003); and the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, Washington, D.C. (1997). Her work has recently been featured in exhibitions at the Art Institute of Chicago, the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam, the Museum of Fine Arts in Ghent, Belgium, and the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York, which included her in its 1991, 2000, and 2008 biennials. Pieces by the artist are in the collections of the Museum of Modern Art, the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Guggenheim Museum, LACMA, the Art Institute of Chicago, and Tate Britain.
