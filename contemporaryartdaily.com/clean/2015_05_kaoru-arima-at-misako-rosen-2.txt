MISAKO &amp; ROSEN is pleased to announce the presentation of our second solo exhibition with Kaoru Arima. Arima was born in 1969 in Aichi and is presently based in Chiba, Japan. In the early 2000s, Arima exhibited internationally at venues such as the Walker Art Center, MN (How Latitudes Become Forms, 2003) and the 54th Carnegie International (2004, PA). In Japan, Arimas work was featured in a solo exhibition at Watari-Um in 2003 and in 2007, Arima was included in the Mito Art Tower exhibition The Age of Micropop : The New Generation of Japanese Artists. In 2012, Tokyo-based artist run-space XYZ Collective included Arima in the exhibition Family Affair. Most recently, Arima presented his work in Now Japan at Kunsthal Kade, Amersfoort and as part of the Queer Thoughts curated exhibition Rainbow in Nicaragua. In 2015, Arima took part in Im sorry, please talk more slowly at Hikarie, Shibuya.
With the present exhibition, Kaoru Arima furthers his highly distinct experiments in contemporary painting. Related to his more loosely constructed works on paper, the new paintings reflect Arimas concern with a structure determined by play with color and painterly touch. As in multiple and varied historical points of reference in painting such as Rembrandts -black-, Picassos -Cubism-. Warhols -layering-, Arimas practice, in general, is a process in which new developments may seem accidental and in-flux, yet this is his intent to generate a sense of time and play. Human faces in Arimas work have over time become less representative of an emotional expression and more matter-of-fact pictures of types.
