The year is 2016. Everything has gone to s***. For Toilet,his second exhibition at Jenny’s, Mathieu Malouf presents a series of new paintings and a sculptural work inspired by the infamous Blue Condominium in the Lower East Side of New York, a prominent eyesore on the skyline and a landmark for chic sustainable living and the spread of gentrification. Several of Malouf’s paintings feature the greedy, sadistic figure of the Grinch, who haunts cafes and condos and toilets with an evil grin, a looming spectre of capitalism. The sculpture is a scaled down condo-cum-outhouse to offer relief while viewing the exhibition, a transparent receptacle which inverts private and publics pace.
