think of me
you may read UKNIT as a unit.
as knitting produces a unity (a blank(et))
what you see is deconstruction of unity into pattern and movement.
there is no guiding thread going through the work.
it is temporary.
it‘s rhythm, as sense is movement.
rhythm as stored on tapes or reels and reals as cultural techniques
and pre-conscious memories in transitions.
the dust is moving anti-clockwise into the navel
like all cyclones in the north.
think of me
(whispers the dust*)
