Simon Preston is delighted to present Josh Tonsfeldtâ€™s third exhibition at the gallery, opening on Wednesday 24 April and running until 2 June, 2013. This will be followed by an accompanying exhibition at Galerie VidalCuglietta, Brussels, opening 24 May until 12 July, 2013.
Often beginning with personal history, degrees of removal are enacted onto materials and form. Disrupting fixed moments in a photograph by intervening in each layer of the process from capturing, storing, organizing and printing, the subject is abstracted into something broader and more universal.
This exhibition begins with a diagrammatic layering of three places: the floor plans of an abandoned family home in Iowa, Simon Preston Gallery and Galerie VidalCuglietta. The central component in both shows is a structure which follows the outline of the home which burned down several years ago. Each exhibition space represents overlapping sections of the home here represented by eighteen plaster casts of the gallery floor and traces of furniture. Tonsfeldt sifted through and collected materials from around the house, and these elements, along with photographs and video from the site serve as starting points for other works within the show.
