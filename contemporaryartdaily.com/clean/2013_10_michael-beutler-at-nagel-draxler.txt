The invention of his own artistic manufacturing marks the starting point of Michael Beutlers working process. He constructs complex machines out of simple materials that produce roughly standardized elements serving as parts for his sculptures and installations. In his works the input of labour becomes visible as a form of constructive, unalienated human productivity. The five sculptures on display in the exhibition are the results of Beutlers experimenting with the sausage machine which he invented during his stay at Atelier Calder at the beginning of this year. They are set on a 16 metre long carpet that Beutler, together with his team, fabricated with a giant-sized, self-built weaving loom that will be exhibited at the Mus√©e dArt Moderne Paris from October 2013 till February 2014.
Michael Beutler, born 1976 in Oldenburg, lives and works in Berlin. He has been showing his work internationally in institutions such as ZKM Karlsruhe, Staatliche Kunsthalle Baden-Baden, MOCA Museum of Contemporary Art Taipei, MMK Franfurt a.M. or Bundeskunsthalle Bonn. This is his third solo exhibition with Galerie Nagel Draxler
