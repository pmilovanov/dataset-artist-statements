Document is pleased to present Psychopompopolis, Erin Jane Nelson’s second solo exhibition at the gallery. This body of work continues the artist’s practice of printing and collaging photographic experiments on fabric, which are often displayed in a site-specific environment. The works in the exhibition are based on a short story by Nelson of the same name.
