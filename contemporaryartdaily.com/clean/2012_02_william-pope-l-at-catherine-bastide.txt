Pope.Ls second exhibition at Catherine Bastide Gallery is entitled Three Projects and is comprised of actually four projects.
From the ceiling, the artist has hung a large fragmented figural work that drips chocolate and i called A Vessel In A Vessel In A Vessel. Two works ring the walls of the space: 21 drawing from Pope.Ls ongoing racialist drawing enterprise entitled Skin Set. Interspersed between the drawings at uneven intervals is Polis, a set of intimately scaled shelf pieces; each holds a single painted onion.On the floor is a tall glass of milk entitled WELL.
Pope.L continues his longtime interest in the use of organic materials, a playful dispersal of media, format and language in order to create an exhibition that hovers between ideas, sensibilities, artworks and projects without loyalty to any.
