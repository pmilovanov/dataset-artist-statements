The work of Maria Lassnig (b. 1919 Austria, lives and works in Vienna) is an exploration of the human body. Her oeuvre, characterized be a very typical colour palate and an expressionistic distortion of the body, has been included in several exhibitions since the 1950s, but has mainly received international acclaim in the last twenty years. Her work deals with both the strength and fragility of the human body. This exhibition is realized in collaboration with the Neue Galerie Graz / Universalmuseum Joanneum and the Deichtorhallen in Hamburg.
