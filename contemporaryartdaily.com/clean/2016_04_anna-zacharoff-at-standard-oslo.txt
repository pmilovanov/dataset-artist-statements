STANDARD (OSLO) is proud to announce an exhibition of new works by Anna Zacharoff. Entitled “Im Flattened to Be Asked” it is comprising of eleven paintings and three sculptures.
1. Listen: easier said than done, and thats exactly the point
2. Agreement: say yes and add something, dont reject ideas
3. Team Work: have a group mind, think of others
4. Dont Block: stealing jokes / not listening / changing topic
5. Relationship: focus on connection between characters, not just subject of scene
6. Initiation: who, what, when to set the scene
7. Point of View, Opinion and Intention: have them, these help express and build your character
8. Be in Character: maintain character throughout the scene
9. Dont Ask Questions: too many questions can make your partner do all the work
10. Make Active Choices: do something, dont be talking heads
