Martos Gallery is pleased to present LAT. 41° 7 N., LONG. 72° 19 W., a group show which will take place at its summer location in East Marion, New York. Organized by Bob Nickas, and his fourth off- site exhibition for the gallery, the title refers to the coordinates of the property. Many of the works have been made expressly for the show, or have been conceived especially for the site—10 wooded acres which sits between Orient Harbor and Long Island Sound. A number of artists who are not usually associated with outdoor works will take advantage of the expansive outdoor gallery that the natural setting provides. With 66 artists, it is by far the largest of these annual shows, split evenly between those who have been previously included, and 33 artists who are participating for the very first time. In addition, a significant number of artists, as well as the curator, have a strong connection to the North Fork of the island, and for them the landscape is familiar, formative, and alive—in many ways serving as an escape from the studio as well as a source for the ideas which animate their minds and drive their work from one summer to the next.
