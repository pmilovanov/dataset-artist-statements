NEW YORK The Paula Cooper Gallery is pleased to announce an exhibition of new works by Kelley Walker, on view at 534 West 21st Street from October 31 through December 13, 2008.
Highly conceptual and visually provocative, Kelley Walkers work tackles some of todays most complex debates around issues of circulation and reproduction, authenticity and authorship, and the banality and conventions of the image. Showing a particular interest in the changes brought about by the use of computers, Walker has been investigating the ways in which images can be sampled, altered, disseminated and then re-appropriated.
For his third one-person show at Paula Cooper Gallery, the artist will present new work that engages the relationships and limitations between image and architecture. With constructed interventions into the gallery space and digitally manipulated images, this work will expand on the artists interest in challenging the stability of physical, visual and virtual modes of experience.
Kelley Walker was born in 1969 in Columbus, Georgia and lives in New York. In 2007, his work was the subject of a one person show at Le Magasin Centre National dart Contemporain in Grenoble, France. From September through November of this year, this show will be presented at the Wiels Contemporary Art Center in Brussels, Belgium. His work was included in the Greater New York 2005 exhibition at P.S.1 Contemporary Art Center and in the 7th Sharjah Biennial in the United Arab Emirates. Walker also participated in the Whitney Biennial 2006, as well as Infinite Painting, curated by Francesco Bonami for the Villa Manin Center for Contemporary Art in Passariano, Italy.
Kelley Walker also makes work in collaboration with artist Wade Guyton, under the name Guyton/Walker.
