Seeing is Believing features photos by the German, Hamburg-based photographer, which continue the artist’s on-going investigation of the relationship between human beings and the natural world. Accordingly, the exhibition revolves around issues of seeing and being seen, and the implicit beliefs that undergird both.
In confronting and challenging anthropocentric assumptions of perception, these images portray a selection of flora and fauna in various states of being, at times furtively, and at others, frontally.
In many cases the photographic object (a deer, or pigeons, or a praying mantis) is depicted in such a way that it seems to be re- turning the viewer’s gaze – an anthropomorphism that presupposes a kindred act of discovery, a will to study, and, ultimately, the possibility of being understood. In other cases, what is portrayed (a mutilated fish head) threatens to dissolve into an abstraction that confounds the human will to apprehend and organize the perceived world into identifiable wholes. In both cases, seeing is indeed driven by a will to believe, but believing does not necessarily lead to seeing.
