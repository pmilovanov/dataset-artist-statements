The Henry presents the first American survey of the influential German artist Franz Erhard Walther (born 1939), featuring nearly 300 pivotal works from the last six decades, many never previously exhibited in the United States.
The exhibition considers the complex and rich relationship that drawing—in its broadest and most conceptual sense—has had within Walthers entire production since the late 1950s. The flexibility of the medium, as well as its capacity to transform itself without losing its inherent qualities has fascinated the artist since his earliest memories, as has its intrinsic relationship to writing and language.
Walther—long considered an artists artist—has influenced the wider discussion about contemporary art practice, while his art has served as a point of origin for many younger artists whose work directly or indirectly expands on diverse aspects of his groundbreaking investigations.
One of Germanys most prominent artists since the 1960s, Walthers work was included in When Attitudes Become Form (Kunsthalle Bern, 1969) and dOCUMENTA V (Kassel, 1972) both curated by Harald Szeemann. His first American group exhibition in 1970 was Spaces at the Museum of Modern Art. Recent exhibitions include Franz Erhard Walther, MUDAM, Luxembourg (2015); WIELS Centre dArt Contemporain, Brussels (2014) and CAPC Musée dArt Contemporain de Bordeaux, France (2014); and Dia Art Foundation, New York (2010–12).
His work is in the permanent collections of Museum of Modern Art, Dia Art Foundation, Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago, Art Institute Chicago, The Centre Pompidou, Walker Art Center, and Musée dArt Moderne Grand-Duc Jean, Luxembourg, Nationalgalerie Berlin, Hamburger Kunsthalle, Kunsthaus Zürich, Museum für Moderne Kunst Frankfurt, Van Abbemuseum Eindhoven, and MAMCO Musée dArt Moderne et Contemporain, Geneva.
The exhibition will feature daily activations of elements from the 1. Werksatz (First Work Set) (1963-69).
