SOLUTIONS TO COMPOUND PROBLEMS depicts two site-specific works at Galerie Isabella Bortolozzi, Berlin. The interior architectural features of the gallery, located in a Gründerzeit-era apartment, formed the basis of the first work, Toter Winkel (2010). The second work, Untitled (2014), portrays three gallerists of matrilineal descent, Monika Schmela, Ulrike Schmela-Brüning, and Lena Brüning, who operated her gallery from 2012-2013 in the apartment directly above Galerie Bortolozzi.
