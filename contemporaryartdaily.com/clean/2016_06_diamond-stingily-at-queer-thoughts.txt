I have seen all the dead seasons, Kaa said at last, and the great trees and the old elephants, and the rocks that were bare and sharp-pointed ere the moss grew. Art thou still alive – Kaa, The Jungle Book
It is a lonely life to be a snake. To be ancient, forever in your prime. A mentor and a friend becomes the enemy when one cannot speak. The mentor, the friend still cast their skin in order to grow knowing there is beauty in struggles.
Was Medusa a Gorgon or a misunderstood woman? There would be hesitation to say she was evil if the listener could hear her speak.
The Jungle Book is a misinterpreted childhood favorite. The fear of snakes is possibly the fear of oneself. Afraid of seduction, the confidence and being hypnotised by the charmer.
They taunted me, they called me Medusa, said the girl, They told me I looked like the comedic snake, the Disney version. I didn’t know he was powerful, majestic, to be respected. And like him I learned who I was and now I know who I am.
