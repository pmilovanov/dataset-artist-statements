Two underage models were hired from the agency to perform a single task: to reproduce each other, to see each other in the ways that they want to be seen.
The experiment was compromised at two points:
1. The setting was modeled to mimic the Dream House at 275 Church Street, a sound and light installation by Marian Zazeela and La Monte Young
2. The Infrared 35mm film used to document the experiment was previously exposed to formal studies of:
a. characteristic echoes of the Dream House
b. the motor of a car
