Tomorrow is pleased to present “A Salted Quarterly: Notes from the Why Axis” an exhibition with Ben Schumacher and Carlos Reyes. This marks the first collaborative exhibition between the two artists. Here, various spacial elements are interconnected to create a system which traces the oscillating movements between temperature, sound, and information. The artists utilize the objects and images to highlight the material points of convergence; microphones are encased in ice, 3D prints are constructed from architectural elevator scans, a silhouette of the Toronto skyline is drawn with audio cables. These material layerings bleed into performative online documentation.
