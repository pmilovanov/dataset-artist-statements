Michael Werner Gallery is pleased to present Klara 13 Pictures, an exhibition of works by Elizabeth Peyton.
Elizabeth Peyton is a painter, notably of portraiture and still-life. Her works seek to explore individuality, atmosphere and the expressive potential of paint.
Depictions of the artist Klara Liden have appeared with some frequency in the artist’s oeuvre in recent years. This exhibition brings many of these works together for the first time. Klara 13 Pictures is comprised of related paintings, drawings and prints created in the past four years.
Peyton’s repetition of a single subject over time and across a range of media allows for a classical meditation on subject as motif. Each variation of the ongoing motif is an occasion for experimentation, and an opportunity for viewers to expand their understanding of the sitter. Contemplative and challenging, the works in Klara 13 Pictures reveal the artist’s emotional versatility and painterly inventiveness.
Recent solo museum exhibitions include Live Forever (2008), New Museum of Contemporary Art, New York, which traveled to Walker Art Center, Minneapolis, Whitechapel Gallery, London, and Bonnefanten Museum, Maastricht; Reading and Writing (2009), Irish Museum of Modern Art, Dublin; Wagner (2010), Gallery Met at the Metropolitan Opera, New York City; and Ghost (2011), a retrospective of the artist’s prints presented concurrently at the Mildred Lane Kemper Art Museum, St. Louis, and Opelvillen Stiftung, Rüsselsheim, Germany. Here She Comes Now, a survey exhibition of the artist’s works from the last 20 years, is currently on view at Staatliche Kunsthalle Baden-Baden. Elizabeth Peyton lives and works in New York and Berlin.
