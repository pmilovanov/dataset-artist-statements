Capitain Petzel is pleased to announce the second solo exhibition by visual artist and musician Stephen Prina, titled »As He Remembered It« which will be on view on three levels of the gallery’s exhibition space from November 24, 2017 to January 13, 2018. The exhibition is an abridged version of the installation of the same title originally exhibited at Secession 2011 and Los Angeles County Museum of Art, 2013. The most recent example of the ongoing project entitled »Exquisite Corpse: The Complete Paintings of Manet« will be included in the exhibition, amongst others.
»As He Remembered It« is linked to an anecdote that Stephen Prina recalls as follows:
»Sometime in the early-to-mid 1980s, Chris Williams and I found ourselves on La Brea Avenue in Los Angeles late one night. From across the street, we could see a spotlighted, pink object showcased in a storefront window, but, from our vantage point, we could not identify it. We crossed the street to gain a closer look. Conveniently, a label describing the object as a piece of furniture by R. M. Schindler was on display. Clearly, this desk that had once been built-in had been pried out of its surroundings with the attempt to render it freestanding. However, it appeared to us as an amputated limb.«
