Kunsthall Stavanger is proud to present the first survey show of Lina Viste Grønlis work. Viste Grønli (b. 1976 in Bergen) has exhibited at several contemporary art spaces in Norway and internationally during the last ten years.Tinging is an ambitious presentation of old and new works, which explore the construction and deconstruction of language. Viste Grønli investigates collective references and challenges our conceptual understanding through semantic collages and semiotic appropriation.

She has exhibited at MAK – Museum for Applied Art, Wien; Marres Centre for Contemporary Culture, Maastricht; Wiels Contemporary Art Centre, Brussel; Performa 09, New York; Sunday Art Fair, London; Henie Onstad Kunstsenter, Bærum; and Gaudel de Stampa, Paris.
