Suse Weber works with a decidedly complex system of signs and denotations she continuously rechoreographs, mirrors, turns and breaks apart again in so called „emblematic sculptures.“ Hereby Suse Weber combines a socio-politically charched image vocabulary with current issues to publicly address political situations and social ruptures.
In her fourth solo presentation at Galerie Barbara Weiss Suse Weber put variations on two motives on display; bear and eagle as figures of collapsing systems, both historical and present.
