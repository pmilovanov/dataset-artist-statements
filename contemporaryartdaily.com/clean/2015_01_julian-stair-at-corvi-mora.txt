Tommaso Corvi-Mora is pleased to present a new project by Julian Stair, in his first exhibition at the gallery.
The exhibition will represent Julian Stair’s interpretation of the great historical dinner service and is a natural continuation of his previous body of work, “Quietus”, which explored our relationship with death and the human body through the physicality of clay and anthropomorphism of the vessel.
“Quotidian” continues Julian Stair’s exploration of the multivalence of pottery. From the optic to the haptic and from the temporal to the kinaesthetic, Stair’s work insists on a social locus for the appreciation of art. The exhibition celebrates the dynamics of use and the way that pottery permeates and is integral to human experience.
Julian Stair has been exhibiting internationally for over 30 years. His work is in more than twenty public collections, including the Victoria and Albert Museum, the British Council Collection and the Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen in Rotterdam. His most recent project was the exhibition “Quietus: The Vessel, Death And The Human Body”, commissioned by mima, Middlesbrough Institute of Modern Art and supported by Arts Council England.
