Wasteful Illuminations
2008 – ongoing
Wasteful Illuminations developed from a recording session – references were made to the surroundings in which the recording took place, including the architectural details of the gallery space, many of which were accustomed and manipulated to belong to the totality of the narration and evening itself. These references to the present alternated with the narratives of the past, which became a system of correspondences which also acted as props and prompts to memory.
The narrative was dotted with references to fish, fountains, ponds, ceramics, basins, lavatories, tiles, cleanliness, water, flows, transparency, photography, glass, grids. A ceramic model of the gallery space where the recording took place continued to materialise and fracture such compound themes and became an accompanying material illustration to the recording. Prior to the recording session a script was written, yet never directly referred to, but later re-integrated into the entirety of the work and enabled new threads to expand and return to the narrational origins of the piece, that being Japan.
