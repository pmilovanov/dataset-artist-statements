I do not have free will; I am not free. I am a functionary of programs that are alien to me; I am an instrument. Not being free I do not surprise. I am predictable. History has been overcome. I am in paradise. Pre-planned, individuated, verbalized, played, viewed, and populated. Paradise is unbearable.
