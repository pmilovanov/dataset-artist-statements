This is Lecia Dole-Recios fifth solo exhibition at Richard Telles Fine Art, Los Angeles. It is also notably her first exhibition in which all her paintings are on linen.
Lecia Dole-Recio has always considered her practice as rooted in painting; though in form and execution, the work alludes to drawing and collage. Dole-Recios work also is likened to architecture, in that her grids and maps are seen as parallel to blueprints. Indeed, her body of work includes drawing, collage, and painting on paper all of which, because of the layering and tactility of the pieces, lends itself to a complex, painterly effect. With her multi-faceted approach, the work explores the oppositions of materials with ideas of the immaterial. This abstraction, tension, and gorgeous mayhem imbue Dole-Recios work with dynamism, intrigue, and give form to that which is ineffable.
Lecia Dole-Recio lives and works in Los Angeles. Her work has been shown extensively and internationally, including a MOCA Focus exhibition at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles in 2006, Johann Konig in Berlin, and Casey Kaplan Gallery in New York.
