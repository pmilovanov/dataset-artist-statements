Installed on the first and second floors of Central Library, duplicate materials from Reading’s Toy Library, Audio and Reference Collections, are presented on library furniture. In order to borrow materials from the Toy Library for the exhibition’s duration, new toys have been bought to replace and add to the loaned ones, which will then enter into the Libraries’ collections after exhibition. These materials collectively form a new work by Leung, Public Sculpture, which will be available for exhibition loan from the Toy Library, as well as each individual toy being available for standard library loan. A unique catalogue publication made by Leung in collaboration with students from the University of Reading and including photos of the exhibition will be made available for reference only in the Local Studies Collection after the exhibition.
Local Studies is part of the collaborative project reading in Reading with artists David Conroy, Cally Spooner and Jesper List Thomsen. Continuing from the artists’ collaborative editing practice used to write a ‘Superstructure’, Local Studies parses materials from the library, subtracting and duplicating these forms in circulating composition.
