Celebrated as one of the most innovative sculptors of our time, Katharina Fritsch (German, b. 1956) mines the history, myths, and fairy tales of Germany as well as her own thoughts and dreams to explore the nature of human perception and experience. By using everyday objects as subject matter—small animals, body parts, religious figurines, and other elements from the made and natural worlds—and altering them through unexpected shifts in scale, color, and materials, Fritsch evokes a sense of wonder and blurs the boundaries between the ordinary and the deeply symbolic.
Katharina Fritsch: Multiples spans the artist’s career, from early examples from her student years at the Düsseldorf Kunstakademie to later pieces, providing a look into her long-standing themes and ideas through some 40 works drawn from the Walker’s collection.
The show is presented as a companion exhibition to celebrate the installation of Fritsch’s monumental new work in the Minneapolis Sculpture Garden. The 20-foot-high ultramarine blue Hahn/Cock(2013/2017), the artist’s largest public art piece in a US museum collection, will be unveiled in the newly renovated Garden in June 2017.
