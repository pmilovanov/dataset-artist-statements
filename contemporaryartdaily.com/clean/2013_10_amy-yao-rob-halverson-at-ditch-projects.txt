He can tell from her accent (which is kind acute) that she is a Vowelly Girl.
A little morning sickness on semi-clean, long lines and some more peaky sections. Overcast skies with light/ variable WNW winds. Two volunteers pitch in to help an Oregon Department of Transportation employee clear a fallen tree, and a storm watcher makes like a human parachute. A black spot in the bay turns out to be a surfer.
He looks her over. Shes short and has a nice assonance. She sure is a cipher sore is, thinks this consonantal dude, Ill bet she gives good letterhead.
His initial reaction is so pronounced, he doesnt know what to say. He is, at present, tense.
