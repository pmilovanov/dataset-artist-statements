PETER FEND INVENTED THE
FORM OF WRITING A WHOLE
PLANET COULD DO FURTHER
BECAUSE IT DERIVES FROM
THE NATURE OF ALPHABETS
NOT AN AIM TO BE ON TOP
SIGNS TALK DOWN BUT THE
WORD STACKS AGGLOMERATE
THEY BUBBLE UP FROM ANY
PERSON WITH AN ALPHABET
TRAINING FROM CHILDHOOD
DEMOCRACY HAS NEW POWER
WORD STACKS WILL SPREAD
AS A WAY TO COMMUNICATE
AND ESTABLISH COMMUNITY
AND, THEY ARE EASIER TO
READ THAN THE PARAGRAPH
BECAUSE THEY ARE GRAPHS
NOT PARA-GRAPHS BUT THE
REAL GRAPH, AS A LAYOUT
SPATIAL LOGIC ORGANIZES
VISUAL LANGUAGE WITH AN
ART THAT INTEGRATES ALL
AROUND US: ARCHITECTURE
LITERARY INVENTION WILL
COME FROM ARCHITECTURAL
HABITS OF THOUGHT TODAY
HOW CAN THE CIA CONTROL
SUCH A NEW WAY TO WRITE
FINALLY JAMES BOND MUST
RELENT, GIVING WAY TO A
FORCE OF COMMON THOUGHT
BY A CITIZEN NAMED FEND
