Sprung a Leak 2016 explores the movement of data, artificial intelligence, and the relationship between humans and machines. This brand new installation examines the increasing influence that new technologies have on how we feel and act.

Sprung a Leak 2016 draws on research in the fields of science, technology, film and theatre. Visitors are invited into a narrative loop that unfolds across multiple screens, robots, a fountain and other sculptural elements. Through conversations between the robots and human performers appearing on the digital screens, a story will unfold exploring our emotions and vulnerabilities in an ever evolving, digital world.
