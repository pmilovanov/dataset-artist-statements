The exhibition principally concentrates on the figure of the adolescent as he emerged in Klosswoski’s works of the late 80’s. This figure had assumed a number of earlier forms, initially as Antoine in Roberte ce Soir, Petit F and Petit X of the same scenario, and later as Ogier in the Baphomet, and finally again as the Immortal of his last text, from which the title of this show is taken.
