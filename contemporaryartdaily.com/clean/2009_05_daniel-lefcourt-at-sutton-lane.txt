Sutton Lane is pleased to present the first solo exhibition in London of New York based artist Daniel Lefcourt.
On view are four solid wooden objects, two transparency projections and two drawings on acetate. The transparencies are output using a computer pen-plotting device. The solid wooden pieces are output by a computer-controlled router, which both carves and cuts-out forms that are filled or outlined.
Throughout the exhibition Lefcourt explores written and visual language, a mutually inclusive interaction where text and image is mirrored and displaced. Meaning is simultaneously constructed and evaded, deflected and defined. The scale, placement, visual repetition, and graphic contrast of each work seem to be heavily weighted with signification, yet what this work signifies is left conspicuously open.
The artworks reflect on the particularly contemporary condition of dematerialised image production. The works originate as numeric geometry that has no inherent scale yet these are output as physical drawings and solid wooden objects.
Within the exhibition the artist displays the different elements to his work examining the process of production, at the same time investigating modes of display.
Daniel Lefcourt lives and works in Brooklyn, New York. He received his MFA from Columbia University in 2005.
He has an upcoming solo exhibition at Luis Campa√±a in Berlin. His work will be included in a group exhibition at Gallery Lelong, New York opening in June.
He has had solo exhibitions at Sutton Lane, Paris (2007), Galerie Mitterand + Sanz, Zurich (2007), Taxter and Spengemann in New York (2006). Lefcourts work has been featured in numerous group shows including Subject Index at Malmo Kunstmuseum (2008), The Gold Standard (2006) and Greater New York (2000) at Museum of Modern Art P.S.1 and Do You Like Stuff? at Swiss Institute in New York (2005).
