Therapie Thank You’ is Josephine Pryde’s third exhibition with Reena Spaulings Fine Art. It turns on the possibility that there is potential for relations involving objects and subjects in art practice to be therapeutic. Though there are of course indefinitely many ways to induce operational limits for ‘art’, the very idea that it is (also) therapeutic interests J. Pryde for all kinds of reasons. Pertinent here is that things, objects, and ideas, representations of them, are produced, named and circulated as ‘art’ for use. For this exhibition, Ms. Pryde tried to imagine who might be guardians and who supporters of these tender expressions of the vast, otherwise un- indexed, informing complexities. She pictured a creative lady, tough because responsive, who might fit the bill. This woman would slip into a technologically advanced blouse of an evening and, while gliding through rooms holding glasses of water or occasionally wine, would tirelessly promote the artifacts of her computations, things in whose formal use she believed. Her clothes would be simple and easy to pack and not immediately readable as selected from a terribly recent collection by a famous designer. They would speak of fluid and open movement and, at the same time, suggest in their intricate cut and fold that life is a maelstrom of emotions, hidden, too complex ever fully to be comprehended. The artist would photograph these garments under the apprehension that they could say more to a viewer about such a lady, she felt, than an image of her person ever could. The artist would also provide a sample set of woven objects for contemplation.
