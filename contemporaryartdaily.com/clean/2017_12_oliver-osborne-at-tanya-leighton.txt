Tanya Leighton is very pleased to announce On Swabian Hedonism, Oliver Osbornes first solo exhibition at the gallery. He will present a group of new paintings that include elements of figuration, appropriation and abstraction. These new paintings have been made using oil, silkscreen, and embroidery. The imagery in the show has been drawn from a variety of sources, including a history of a 19th century mineral bath in Stuttgart, a comic co-created by the American cartoonists Brant Parker and Johnny Hart, and a selection of motifs that recur in Osbornes work such as bread, pregnancy, apples and a young Angela Merkel.
