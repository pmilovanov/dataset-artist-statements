Marjorie Strider (1934-2014) was one of the most significant female Pop Artists in the 1960s New York milieu. Strider had taken on some of the most iconic motifs of Pop Art from a distinct female perspective of exuberant counter-appropriation.
A spectacular reintroduction of Strider’s work took place in the 2011 exhibition “Seductive Subversion: Women Pop Artists, 1958 – 1968”, at the Brooklyn Museum. The show featured among other iconic pieces, such as “Girl with Radish” (1963), Strider’s imposing “Triptych II, Beach Girl” (1963), one of the pivotal works from the period, – currently on show at the “International Pop” exhibition at the Walker Art Center (and Dallas and Philadelphia Art Museum).
Marjorie Strider had made a tremendous mark in her generation of advancing representational boundaries of post-war modernism into the liberating language of the Pop-era and beyond from the distinctly emancipatory point of view of a woman avant-gardist of her time.
