With this exhibition Lin May Saeed will present new works, drawings, a relief, a model and texts. The title of the show addresses The Skyscraper, a metaphorical text by Max Horkheimer from 1934. The works in the show are preoccupied by, as Saeed often is, with the question of how we treat animals and the role they play in societies. With the large scale drawing A horizontal view, the ubiquity of animals and their products is highlighted and she compares this with the income of employees in human working environments. Also available for reading will be a 24 page text written by Wirth/Rosen about the question whether animals work.
Lin May Saeeds work in sculpture, installation and texts refers to the human/animal relationship. Her history starting as from 2000 as an activist is bound to her artistic practice. I am drawn to Saeed’s work for how poetically, even sweetly, protests are waged. The topics are big and some could say, deserve a certain volume, but here that aggression is traded for what I believe is a more productive and nurturing position. Can art effect social change? We don’t know, but the suffering of animals is too high not to call attention.
Lin May Saeed (DE/IQ) lives in Berlin, Germany
