Ned Venas paintings combine the artists astute readings of minimalism, post-painterly abstraction, and op-art with a unique technical process to render austere meditations on materiality and art history. For this exhibition, Vena will produce a new series of works utilizing common steel doors and adhesive vinyl, eschewing traditional substrates and mediums to emphasize fundamental concerns of form, process, and concept.
