Thomas Kilpper is well known for his space-filling and sociopolitical installations and interventions. For his works shown in the exhibition he takes used scrap and sheet metall: At first, following the tradition of constructivism, he rivets the pieces of scrap on canvas. In a next step he uses bonnets and scratches in motifs of the contemporary history with physical vehemence and directness.
With his outdoor project Megafon organized by the Kunstverein at the Rosa-Luxemburg-Platz Kilpper recruits the place itself, which he perceives as a place linked with political demonstrations and discussions. He puts an oversized megaphone in front of the Volksbühne, which picks up and interprets symbolically the political history of this place. Therefore he cuts over 50 recycled bonnets into pieces and puts them back together to a form of a trumpet-shaped megaphone. This artwork can be used by everyone in the sense of the Speakers‘ Corner in London.
