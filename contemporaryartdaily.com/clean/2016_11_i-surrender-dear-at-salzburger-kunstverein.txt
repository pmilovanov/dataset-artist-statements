Vienna-based artist Anna-Sophie Berger has invited American artist Hayley Silverman and Kosovar artist Flaka Haliti to co-produce an exhibition that explores the nature and value of constructing social environments of artists. As both a testing ground and a series of expressions made visible, this exhibition serves to both encompass as well as give occasion to possibilities made manifest through an open-sharing and non-dualistic, non-individualistic praxis between these three artists.
The exhibition is comprised of these three divergent artistsâ€™ voices considering the body explicitly and implicitly. American artist Hayley Silverman presents photographs silk-screened on partitions, depicting queer bodies in states of play and pose. Austrian artist Anna-Sophie Berger contributes a series of works, including textiles partly petrified through concrete. Among her artworks, Kosovar artist Flaka Haliti includes sculptures modeled on security barriers that enforce boundaries and borders on unwanted bodies.
