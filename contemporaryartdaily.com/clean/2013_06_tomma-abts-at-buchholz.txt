In her third solo exhibition at Galerie Buchholz, her first at our Berlin gallery, Tomma Abts (b. 1967, lives in London) will present a group of new paintings, a new unique bronze cast, a new series of drawings together with selected works on paper from 1996. For the first time the artist will combine these different groups of works together in an exhibition.
