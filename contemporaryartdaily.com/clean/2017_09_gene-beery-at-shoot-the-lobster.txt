Wall Dancers brings together a group of Gene Beery’s text paintings that defy convention as they appear to be paused in motion across the walls. The paintings, installed, appear as if they’ve endured a California earthquake. The shake up continues into the canvases themselves leaving deconstructed words for the viewer to decipher. The word “TRA” is repeated on multiple canvases demonstrating Beery’s idiosyncratic view of art. “TRA” is both “art” spelled backwards and an extension of the word “etcetera.”
Beery interjects playfulness at every turn. His works continually poke fun at art world rigidity and the worthiness of a painting on canvas. Using humble materials and quick confident marks, he brushes through minimalism and pop sensibilities in one stroke.
Gene Beery (b. 1937 Racine, Wisconsin) lives and works in Sutter Creek, California. Recent exhibitions include Early Paintings / Later Photographs at Algus Greenspon (New York, NY); Keeping a Close Eye on the Wind with Joshua Abelow at Bodega (New York, NY) and I Dropped the Lemon Tart at Lisa Cooley (New York, NY). Beery has been the recipient of many awards and grants including the California State Fair Award of Excellence for Painting, N.E.A. Artist’s Books Grant and the William and Noma Copley Foundation Award for Visual Art.
