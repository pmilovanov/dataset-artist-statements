Gas is a comprehensive exhibition of Trevor Shimizus fart-related works. The works presented here, although absurd in theory and of embarrassing subject matter, are representations of major life events and themes, the big picture birth, death, the divine, and coexistence. Three paintings in particular Praying to the Fart God, Meditating Transcending Earth, and Fart Tragedy are inspired by Italian Renaissance painting. In addition to these epic scenes, romantic works depict various couples enjoying each others company amidst their accumulation of gas, accepting one anothers farts, still in love.
