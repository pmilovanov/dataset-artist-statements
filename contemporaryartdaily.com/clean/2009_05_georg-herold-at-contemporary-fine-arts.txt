Contemporary Fine Arts is pleased to announce two solo exhibitions with new works by Norbert Schwontkowski and Georg Herold in the gallerys space Am Kupfergraben 10.
One should avoid speaking of a principle when considering Georg Herolds work, because quite obviously he himself is interested in not following any principle.
Roof laths, bricks, car paint, caviar whether his material comes from the building supplies store or a delicatessen: Georg Herold loves to take art off the pedestal to put it on the floor, down to earth, as it were. In 1977, he presented his first roof lath at Hamburgs Hochschule für Bildende Künste his art is not just famous for that, but especially for his brick and caviar pictures. With caviar, Herold creates a kind of abstract expressionism on his canvas, frequently numbering the seemingly countless individual grain of caviar. The artist does not make any elaborate sketches or models, but rather tests his ideas directly with and against the material. He creates sculptures by stretching pairs of tights over object-like structures made of foil. In the 1993 work Cross Culture, Herold used roof laths to build a stretcher frame, but instead of canvas, he stretched two pairs of tights diagonally over the ‘image area, using clothespins.
‘I have decided to observe, that is to say, to derive my experiences and views from questioning phenomena, rather than posing questions to others. That means I reject any catering service in matters of the mind.
Contemporary Fine Arts is greatly looking forward to the exhibition ‘Place the Lord. It will be the first solo show at Contemporary Fine Arts with recent sculptures. Georg Herold was born in 1947 in Jena and lives in Cologne.
