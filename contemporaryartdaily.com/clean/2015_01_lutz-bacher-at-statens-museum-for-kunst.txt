Since the mid-1970s Lutz Bacher has explored how identities are presented and mediated in popular culture. She lifts familiar material, such as the Star Trek characters, out of its usual context and allows it to enter into entirely different scenarios, giving rise to new meaning.
The exhibition title has been drawn from an episode from the first season of the Star Trek series and refers to the transition from one state of being to another â€“ from this world to another. This is a familiar rite of passage within science fiction culture, within spiritual thinking, and in literature, where it often signifies a main character moving from one moral level to the next.
Premiering in 1966, the Star Trek TV show has created a universe of outsiders and an alternative world order that has been read as a critical comment on a succession of conflicts pertaining to race, gender, war, etc. More than anything, however, the series is a truly long-lived pop-culture phenomenon: through decades it has reflected and fed the desire for the unknown and the fantastical.
In the exhibition the fictitious Star Trek universe meets a range of portraits of prominent scientists taken from a book entitled Masters of Abstraction. Each in their own ways, these scientists have all contributed to the development of cyberspace. With this move, Lutz Bacher links pop-culture fantasies about outer space with sophisticated scientific research and explorations of e.g. the Internet. Both take place in an abstract space outside our physical realm.
