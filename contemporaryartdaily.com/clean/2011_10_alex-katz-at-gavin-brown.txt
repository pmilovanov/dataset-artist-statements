Gavin Browns enterprise is pleased to announce a solo show by Alex Katz opening September 10. This will be the first exhibition by Katz at GBE and his first show in a New York gallery in 2 years.
Since his emergence in the mid fifties alongside the New York School of painters and poets, Alex Katz has become one of the most influential, iconic and enduring figures in the American cultural landscape. His effect is so over-arching that his presence, his style, his vision are absolutely ubiquitous. He has defined our visual post war gaze, and we gladly see the world through his eyes. Now, at the close of the American era we are forced to reassess ourselves. Katzs resolute fidelity to truth in beauty is revealed. It is as profound and timeless as it is contemporary and essential. Alex Katz is immaculate. He is 83 years old.
Katz has exhibited widely all over the world for half a century; including major touring retrospectives and solo presentations of his work. In 2012 Katz will, amongst other exhibitions, have solo exhibitions at the MFA, Boston and Tate, St Ives.
Alex Katzs work is in the collections of over 100 public institutions worldwide, including: The Museum of Modern Art, New York, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, NY, Whitney Museum of American Art, NY, The Smithsonian Institute, Washington, D.C., Carnegie Museum of Art, The Art Institute of Chicago, Cleveland Museum, The Tate Gallery, London, the Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris, National Gallery of Scotland, Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofia, Madrid, Metropolitan Museum of Art, Tokyo, and the Nationalgalerie, Berlin.
The exhibition will be accompanied by a catalogue illustrating all twenty of Katzs new paintings produced for the show, with text by Lewis Warsh and Angus Cook.
