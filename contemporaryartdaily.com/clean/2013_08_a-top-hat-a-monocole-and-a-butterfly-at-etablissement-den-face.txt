Eustace Tilley, wearing a top-hat, holds up a monocle to look at a butterfly. He seems only marginally interested, as if he were maintaining a necessary critical distance.
Eustace Tilley was born in 1925, but since he doesn’t exist, he wasn’t born in 1925. He was created to represent The New Yorker magazine’s image of au courant sophistication, but looks like a flat pompous idiot from another century. Over the years, hundreds of people have drawn his portrait, and he hasn’t looked the same twice. By having too many faces, he has become faceless.
This is an exhibition that’s not about portraiture. It’s a show of withdrawn or missing faces—faces that appear where they shouldn’t, and don’t where they should. A top-hat, a monocle, and a butterfly describes everything about Eustace Tilley except his face.
