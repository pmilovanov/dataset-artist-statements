Sutton Lane is pleased to present Liz Deschenes first solo exhibition in Paris. On view are four large photograms, non-representational images which are the result of exposing photosensitive paper to outdoor light in the night.
Through applying silver toner to the black and white photographic paper the artist produces slightly reflective sheets, records of the specific physical conditions they were exposed to and of the chemical interaction between light and certain substances.
The works are void of all representational content and circumvent the camera the optical device normally used for the formation of the image reflecting on the procedures that intersect in photography.
Deschenes uses this exploration of photographic processes as a tool to investigate photography itself, the way the medium has been positioned and historicized as well as its relationship to other practices.
In the present installation the works are placed off the centre on the wall referring to the difference between the monocular vision of the camera and the human binocular vision. The conventions of reading and looking are put into play reversing the expectations of the viewer.
Liz Deschenes lives and works in New York. She recently participated in Colour Chart at Tate Liverpool and MoMA, New York curated by Ann Temkin. Her work was also included in the The Art Institute of Chicagoâ€™s Modern Wing Inaugural Installation of Contemporary Photography curated by Matthew Witkovski (2009). The artists work is part of the permanent collection of The Art Institute of Chicago, the Metropolitan Museum, New York, the Corcoran Museum of Art, Washington D.C., the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, Washington D.C and CCS Bard Hessel Museum, Annandale-on-Hudson.
