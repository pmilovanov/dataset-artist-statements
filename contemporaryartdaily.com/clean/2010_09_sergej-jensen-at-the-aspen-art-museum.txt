Sergej Jensen’s poetic artworks provide a fresh approach to minimalist painting. Constructed from a wide range of textiles, the artist uses additive and subtractive physical methods like bleaching, fraying, or sewing to stand in for the traditional gestures of pure painting. Through these processes, Jensen creates breathtakingly fragile and quiet abstractions that become contemplations of the history and reuse of his chosen materials, and conjure a network of visual and visceral associations from the stains, holes, cracks and other traces of use that in turn become the primary pictorial elements. His application of pigments, diamond dust, thread, wool, and bleach become part of the treatments whose effects—in some cases—can take years to fully realize. Jensen’s works are installed within the pre-existing conditions of each individual gallery space. As such, interior design elements such as rugs, couches, or other repurposed domestic objects combine to create a total and unexpected environment for the viewer.
This is Berlin-based artist Jensen’s first U.S. solo museum exhibition. It is organized in collaboration with the Kunst-Werke Institute for Contemporary Art, Berlin, and includes over 25 paintings. It will be accompanied by a monographic catalogue co-published by both institutions, with essays by Aspen Art Museum Director and Chief Curator Heidi Zuckerman Jacobson and an interview with the artist by Kunst-Werke Institute Curator Susan Pfeffer.
