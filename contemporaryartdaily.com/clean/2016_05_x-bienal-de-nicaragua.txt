The X Nicaragua Biennial Fundación Ortiz Gurdian was inaugurated in the cities of Managua, Leon and Bluefields commemorating its 10th edition with the homage to the Caribbean painter June Beer (1935-1986).
The X Nicaragua Biennial is dedicated to June Beer and emphasizes artistic practices as symbolic parables of the relationship of individuals with their environment. Influenced by contemporary production in Nicaragua the exhibition´s central subject is the background, to comment on the global, natural, social and cultural schemes of today.
In June Beer work a body expresses its spatial relationship with the natural environment and culture, her verses, landscapes, portraits and representations of collective moments from the Nicaraguan Caribbean, unfold states, conditions and situations of perceptual dérives of a subjective connection with the environment and the world.
Transposing Beer´s artistic practice to address moments of our contemporaneity, the X Nicaragua Biennial invites us to look at fragments of individuality that inspire our organic / philosophical reasoning, from which collective activities emerge and the possibilities of new concurrences between the individuals and their material and sensitive environment exist.
