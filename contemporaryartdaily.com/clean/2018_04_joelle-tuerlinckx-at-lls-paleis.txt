Joëlle Tuerlinckx works in an intuitive and direct way: straight in the exhibition space, in its scale, in its light. Trying out different options and comparing the results determines the shape of her projects. The exhibition space becomes her studio and material while time, time passing, the present are put on display. Joëlle Tuerlinckx focus, not without a certain sense of humor, is on elements already present in the room, sometimes even taken to the absurd, like little cracks in the wall, which to her are equally expressive.
Having in this way blurred the borders between space and work, the unprepared visitor may at first not notice the work. Because in the world of Joëlle Tuerlinckx, anything can be exhibited. Everything is Culture Kultur Cultuur, as the DAGBLAD LLS Paleis n°1 announces, which will be presented during the opening of the new place.
What is put on display differs only slightly of what was already there, what is and what can become are of equal value. What the visitor will encounter is also postponed. The curtain is drawnand only their attention is required.
In her paintings, sculptures and murals, Tuerlinckx refers to what is already there and renews it and marks it as a trace, for LLS Paleis and its first visitor. A trace of a beginning. Each work of Tuerlinckx is really about a beginning, is an address, a direction towards FOR once again exemplifies this.
