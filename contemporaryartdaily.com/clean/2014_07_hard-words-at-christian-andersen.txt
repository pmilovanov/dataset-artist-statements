In 1962 the Comedian Lenny Bruce goes into semicrouch on stage, puts a raincoat over his head, sticks the mike down his throat and says the line heâ€™d come to love: We are all going to die. He is right, and he is joking. Understanding this can help.
This exhibition is looking at matters of comedy, satire, hyperrealism, art, and language through jumbo glasses.
Welcome to the gallery,
Christian Andersen
