Ratio 3 is pleased to present The Pilgrims Progress, new work by Ben Peterson, on view from January 16 to February 28, 2009.
Ben Peterson will present a series of drawings depicting an imagined collision between two types of themed communities; a golf course retirement development and a historical reenactment theme park. Using the form of fragmented follie-type structures, Peterson attempts to collapse the distinction between authenticity and artifice, entertainment and education. Petersons depicted landscapes are loaded with manicured putting greens, golf bags, historical museum displays, large trees, and the ghosts of pilgrims who bear witness to the collision of Colonial forts, gated developments, golf carts, and shipwrecks. In the work, Petersons structures create a new space where history, both of the winners and the losers, contaminates the present, giving rise to a hybrid stage that is neither completed nor abandoned.
Ben Peterson was born in 1977 in Hawthorne, Nevada. He graduated from the California College of the Arts in 2004 with a B.F.A. in Painting. His work has been included in exhibitions at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, PA (2008), Neuberger Museum of Art, NY (2008), Institute of Contemporary Art, Philadelphia, PA (2007), Indianapolis Museum of Art, IN (2007), Mary Goldman Gallery, Los Angeles (2006), and the Deste Foundation Centre for Contemporary Art, Athens, Greece (2006). Peterson currently lives and works in Philadelphia, PA. This is his third solo exhibition with Ratio 3.
