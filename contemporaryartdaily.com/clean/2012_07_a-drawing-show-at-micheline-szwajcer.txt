I have selected some of my favorite drawings submitted to me by favorite artists, including middle-aged, young artists whose work is best known in the area of performance or large sculpture. My main criteria aside from the works’ aesthetic qualities, is the way the work deals with clichés and eccentric humor. — Dan Graham
