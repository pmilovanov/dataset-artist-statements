The exhibition is composed of an assembly of films, displayed in the exhibition rooms of the gallery next to a selection of sculptures, showcased in the two small spaces on the top floors, which were up until now closed to the public.
The selection of films (generated for a screening together with Jonathan Pouthier at the Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris) is here on view as a spatial installation and invites to discover two of the three recent films by Isabelle Cornaro (Amplification, Choses and Métronomie, all 2014) and one earlier film (Figures, 2011) amongst works by cineasts and artists of the American avant- garde of 1940 to 1960. The French-born artist (*1974) chose films that embody both sources as well as extensions of her own interest: They were realized on the margins of the dominating film industry and present various forms ranging from the art work to the advertisement to the documentation of a performance. They construct a fragmented representation of the artists interests on the fetishism of objects, methods of combination, modes of construction and formal image systems, which are all to be re-found in Isabelle Cornaro’s own films and her sculptures (Orgon Doors, 2014), presented in the upper floors.
In other words, apart of the tension between their aesthetic and cultural value of everyday objects, this show especially investigates the role that color inhabits in Isabelle Cornaro’s work: while animating the objects in her films, it is of modeling and paralyzed character in her sculptures, increasingly shifting from the inside to the outside: from monochrome casts to color splashes as far as to the complete externalization when reluctantly appearing in colored frames.
