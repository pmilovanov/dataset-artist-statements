The exhibition title, ZOO(M) DE LARGE (JAIL D’ART), stresses the exhibition’s theme with the usual Meesic linguistic cunning. Animals of all types show up as concrete figures in the German artists paintings, but with potentially ambiguous interpretation in relation to the animal in human beings. The works in the exhibition also make clear references to the cage and the captive animals.
ZOO(M) DE LARGE (JAIL DART) is Jonathan Meese’s second solo exhibition at Galleri Bo Bjerggaard, which in 2008 housed his exhibition BABYPROPAGANDADDYS Metabolismys (FISHYALARM IN ANTARCTICA ON BOHRINSEL MOOMIN). On that occasion, Meese displayed his distinctive and highly expressive style through a wide range of media, including drawing, collage, painting, photography, sculpture, video and installation. Within the last year, however, Meese’s primary focus has been on painting, as reflected in the current exhibition, which, with the exception of a single site-specific installation, consists exclusively of brand new paintings.
Since his debut on the international art scene in 1998, Jonathan Meese has gained immense fame and his works can be found in a number of international museum collections, including the Centre Pompidou in Paris and MoMA in New York. Here in Denmark his works are represented in Louisiana, ARoS, the Holstebro Art Museum and the National Gallery of Denmark, where he (along with his good friend and colleague Tal R) presented the Mother exhibition back in 2005. In 2012 GL STRAND had the exhibition Jonathan Meese EVOLUTION de LARGE (ICH-TEA-OHHH-SAURYS). Meese is presently the subject of a large retrospective painting exhibition at Salzburg’s Museum der Moderne.
