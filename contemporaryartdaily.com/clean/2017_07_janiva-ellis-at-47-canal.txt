Like a shot fired from a dream, laughter in the dark, or an underwater scream, this exhibition is a series of glimpses into the divine comedy of existing in a world where pain is met with doubt; into dynamics that are blatant and never-ending, yet consistently denied their truth. Playfulness provides a brief reprieve from spiraling. Run headlong into a brick wall or be sprung by a rubbery spring; if one is blunt, the other is jovial and forgiving. A score of hits and recoveries, each collision wipes the shock of the last one with a fresh sensation.
