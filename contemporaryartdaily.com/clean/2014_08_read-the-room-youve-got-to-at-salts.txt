The exhibition “read the room / you’ve got to” explores the current blurring of borders between poetic and visual arts practices, as well as analogue and digital processes, while taking up the history of mail art in the internet age. The show is comprised of works on A4 paper—many of them made specifically for this exhibition—that the participating poets and artists chose to mail or email to the curator. In the case of the latter, the works were then printed out using a standard inkjet printer. From poems crafted from email spam to poems made from film-still subtitles to poems emerging from more traditional painting and drawing and typographic practices, the works on view describe the discursive range of contemporary poetics and the visual art oeuvres under that indelible influence.
Curated by Quinn Latimer, The Printed Room (2011–) is a parallel project at SALTS, Basel, which explores ideas of literature, poetics, and print in changing exhibitions of literary-minded material. Past shows include “Your Palindrome, Her Abecedarium,” which featured a private library organized in abecedary and palindromic form (2012), and “Emmy Moore’s Journal: An Exhibition Based on a Letter in a Short Story by Jane Bowles” (2013), which traced concerns of architecture, interiority, gender, Orientalism, and the epistolary impulse in works by Ruth Buchanan, Moyra Davey, Shana Lutker, Charlotte Moth, Amalia Pica, Sam Porritt, Vanessa Safavi, Sylvia Sleigh, Danh Vo, and Jennifer West, among others.
