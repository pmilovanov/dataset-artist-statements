VIOLENT FEMMES is a film that Lotringer made from documentation material he has collected since the 80’s. This film was edited in 1998 and shown for the first time in 2015. Catherine Robbe-Grillet, a Parisian dominatrix, was invited to visit Lotringer’s loft on Front Street, and meet Mlle Victoire, her American counterpart.
