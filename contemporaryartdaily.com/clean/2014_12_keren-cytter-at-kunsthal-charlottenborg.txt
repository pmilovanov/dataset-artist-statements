For her comprehensive solo exhibition at Kunsthal Charlottenborg Keren Cytter presents two series of new drawings, a selection of eight films that includes signature pieces and new works, as well as a two-part text piece relating the works to each other and to the galleries where they are situated.
Keren Cytter uses numerous cinematic references in her film works as she ignores, violates and reveals the unwritten rules of filmmaking. Simple editing tricks, visual effects and fast and cheap production are central elements in Cytterâ€™s toolbox, and she is not afraid of quoting, mixing and making styles and genres clash: Home- movie horror meets soap opera and kitsch, lo-fi Hollywood glamour is mashed up with French film noir and the mockumentary genre. The actors often have multiple roles and speak several languages within the same film; sometimes women are acting as men and vice versa. Besides the visual material Cytter also draws heavily on music to create a certain drama and atmosphere within her films. The narratives are often broken up and touch on themes of love, hate, sex, jealousy, revenge and violence.
