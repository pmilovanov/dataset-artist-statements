Lutz Braun’s works are direct, poetic, eerie and in an almost old-fashioned way dreamy. All materials that are suitable as image carrier count, e.g. canvas, wooden panels, carpets. “Poor materials”, available to the artist in his everyday life, mix with his imagination into “another world”, alike a dream. But the alternative world of Lutz Braun is no idyll. His paintings show sceanrios of a post-apocalyptic fiction that, with respect to a destructive, all pervading capitalism founded attack on the humane, is moving ever closer.
