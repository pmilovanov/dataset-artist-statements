The monographic show Tacita Dean at Museo Tamayo will present works in diverse media and will gather, among other pieces, her most recent series of paintings, with the aim of highlighting the relevance of her pictorial work in relation to the development of her oeuvre. It will also exhibit a wide selection of some of her most relevant pieces, which includes 16 mm films. Among this selection is a new analogue film and other productions made for this show.

The first exhibition of Tacita Dean in MÃ©xico, places under observation concepts such as time and casualty in order to establish how these determine the interpretation of the past. Through a series of found documents and objects on the verge of vanishing, a relation between the absent and the act of looking is established in diverse works.
