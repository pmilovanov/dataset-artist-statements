The Gallery of Modern Art is proud to present the debut collaboration between Max Brand (b. 1982, Leipzig) and Joanne Robertson (b. 1979, Manchester). Poppies features new painting and sculpture by both artists, as well as a musical work co-produced in the lead-up to the exhibition’s opening.
The show brings together two international painters, who also work as musicians. Central to the exhibition is Brand and Robertson’s desire to ‘expand’ traditional media. They paint directly onto the wall and floor, as well as displaying huge wall hung canvases, floor sculptures and hanging lights, all accompanied by a sound installation. This approach transforms painting from something restricted within a frame to something resistant to containment. Visitors can expect bright, energetic works that appear to have exploded across the gallery space.
Max Brand lives and works in Berlin. He graduated from the Städelschule Frankfurt/Main in 2010. Recent exhibitions include 9th Berlin Biennale for Contemporary Art, Centre for Style, Akademie der Künste Berlin (2016), A Cowboy Dreams, Off Vendome, NYC (solo) (2016) and Tür, Jacky Strenz, Frankfurt/Main (solo) (2016).
Joanne Robertson lives and works in London. She graduated from the Slade School of Fine Art (MFA Fine Art) in 2006 and Glasgow School of Art (BA, Painting) in 2003. Recent exhibitions include Bob Dylan, (duo show with lucy Stein) invited by Michael Callies, Brussels (2014), Bucket Head, Mangiabarche Gallery, Sardinia (solo with collaborations) (2013) and Set-Up (solo) Limazulu, London (2015).
Poppies explores how contemporary art in Glasgow continues to grow and evolve, considering how art transcends different mediums in the same exhibition.
