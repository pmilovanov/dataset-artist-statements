Virtuoso exponents of line drawings of successions of figures with their roots in the unconscious and popular culture, Moriceau &amp; Mrzyk utilise a range of formats – round frames, A4, A3, etc. – and media that include wall painting and animation. After their Moonraker exhibition at Air de Paris in 2004, with the fragments of Mister Frames dreams rising in a cloud of frames up onto the gallery ceiling, Moriceau &amp; Mrzyk are back with an exhibition of 365 drawings specially done for a 2009–2010 tear-off calendar: one drawing a day as this prolific duo mingles everyday themes and images. Far from being separate works, however, these drawings interact, echo each other and join up in an ongoing movement. Whether cynical, playful, grotesque or absurd, each drawing pulls us into its intuitively created world. This is a total exhibition, one that mistreats the accepted norms, the limitations of the frame and the passing of time.
Jean-François Moriceau &amp; Petra Mrzyk have been working together since 1998. The subject of monographic exhibitions in Spain (Caixa Forum, Barcelona), Germany (Schnitt Ausstellungsraum, Cologne), Switzerland (Mamco, Geneva) and the United States (LACMA, Los Angeles), their work is to be found in many public collections, notably the Musée d’Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris, where a wall painting is on permanent display.
