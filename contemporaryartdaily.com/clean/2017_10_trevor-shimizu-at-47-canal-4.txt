Trevor Shimizu has produced numerous video works that exist in tandem with his work as a painter.
The six video works presented here follow the arc of a personâ€™s life roughly from their mid-twenties into early middle age.
To be clear, the video works are not autobiographical. One would be forgiven for this assumption given the intimate confessional tone as well as the fact that Shimizu casts himself as the main protagonist.
Like his paintings these videos represent observed archetypes Shimizu has witnessed throughout the different stages of his own life.
Each video is presented with accompanying notes from the artist.
