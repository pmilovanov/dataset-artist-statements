Between June 29 and October 12, 2014 the three musea of the Lys Region, the Museum Dhondt-Dhaenens in Deurle, the Roger Raveelmuseum in Machelen-aan-de-Leie and the Museum van Deinze en de Leiestreek are joining forces to mount this Biennale. For the fourth edition of the Biennale of the Art of Painting these museums propose a selection of modern paintings where each museum focuses from a different angle on the brush stroke and the materiality of the painting.
Piet Coessens, curator at the Roger Raveelmuseum: During the Biennale the visitor discovers how a painting can be constructed in different ways. Every painter has his own way of working and uses different techniques and components. Throughout this exhibition we would like to give visitors a sample of the pleasure that painters experience when painting. We show a selection of international artists of the Lys region whilst also creating a dialogue between work of a century ago and recent, modern art.
The Biennale shows works of Belgian artists such as Rover Raveel, James Ensor, Raoul De Keyser and Rik Wouters as well as works from the American pop artists Roy Lichtenstien and Andy Warhol. Next to these established artists, paintings of less known artists will be on display. Jerry Galle, Ermias Kifleyesus and Vincent Geykens are young artists that are worth discovering, says Joost Declercq, curator at the museum Dhondt-Dhaenens.
The Museum van Deinze en de Leiestreek participates for the first time in this Biennale. Following the successful exhibition with works of Albert Saverys, we now emphasize the contemporary brush stroke, says Trui Galle, curator of the Museum van Deinze en de Leiestreek. The Museum shows surprising works of young artists such as Virginie Bailly and Mil Ceulemans next to paintings of well known artists from the Lys region like Emile Claus and Constant Permeke.
