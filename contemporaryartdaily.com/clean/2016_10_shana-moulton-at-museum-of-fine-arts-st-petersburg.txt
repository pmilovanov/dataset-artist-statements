Shana Moulton creates humorous yet earnest explorations of New Age approaches to self-improvement through her alter ego, the bumbling and perpetually-searching Cynthia. In the Whispering Pines series, begun in 2002 and ongoing, we see Cynthia grappling with various maladies, seeking out remedies in the forms of pore strips, massage, neti pots, and the AVON lady. Moulton exhibits a finely-honed lo-fi aesthetic, featuring pastel colors and a cast of kitschy home décor objects. She offers a critical exploration of the commercialism of wellness therapies and products, important to consider in our age of quick-fixes and online searches.

This is Moulton’s first solo museum exhibition in the United States, and features interactive video installations as well as highlighting live performance and opera.
