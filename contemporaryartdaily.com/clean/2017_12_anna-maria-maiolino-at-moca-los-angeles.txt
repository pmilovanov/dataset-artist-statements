MOCA is pleased to present Anna Maria Maiolino, the Brazilian artist’s first major United States museum retrospective. This large-scale survey will cover Maiolino’s extraordinary oeuvre from the early 1960s to the present, bringing together expressive woodblock prints, visceral cement sculptures, politically-charged films and performances, fluid drawings, and monumental installations of unfired clay. Visitors will chart a path through Brazilian art history and many of the major postwar movements, channeled through Maiolino’s intimate and subjective practice exploring her identity as a migrant, mother, and global citizen. Anna Maria Maiolino is part of The Getty Foundation’s Pacific Standard Time: LA/LA initiative, hosted by arts institutions across Southern California and exploring Latino and Latin American Art in dialogue with the city of Los Angeles.
