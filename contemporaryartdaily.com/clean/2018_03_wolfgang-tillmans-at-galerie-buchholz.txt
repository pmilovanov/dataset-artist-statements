Galerie Buchholz is delighted to announce a new exhibition by Wolfgang Tillmans coinciding with the 25th anniversary of our collaboration with the artist. This collaboration began in 1993 with Wolfgang Tillmans’ exhibition at Buchholz &amp; Buchholz in Cologne, his very first solo gallery exhibition. Even then, Tillmans brought together in one installation the various mediums and formats which his work inhabits – c-prints, alongside magazine pages and photocopies – thus developing the unique, multifaceted hanging scheme that has become a key signature of his work.
Fest is Wolfgang Tillmans’ eleventh solo exhibition at Galerie Buchholz, which will once again be held in our Cologne gallery on the occasion of this anniversary. Tillmans will be presenting a diverse spectrum of works from his current practice, including new still lifes, landscape photographs, (self-) portraits, and a new video work.
