Novel, the exhibition, gathers a selection of works by past and present contributors to Novel, a publication project and collection of artist writings, edited by Alun Rowlands (head of the department of Fine Art of Reading University) and Matt Williams (curator of International Project Space, Birmingham and newly appointed curator of the ICA in London). As one of the publications aims is to gather various forms of non- academic texts and poetry oscillating between modes of fiction and criticism, the exhibition at dépendance attempts to bring the focus away from writing as a parallel activity, back to art objects.
New works by Bernadette Corporation, Michaela Eichwald, Gareth James, Sergej Jensen, Oscar Tuazon, Nicholas Byrne and a collaborative work by Simon Thompson &amp; Cheyney Thompson, join works by Henri Chopin, Henrik Olesen, Josef Strau, Merlin Carpenter and Nick Mauss.
Organized by dépendance the exhibition opening on September 10th, commemorates the launch of Novels Issue 3.
