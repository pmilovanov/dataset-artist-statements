In the corners of insignificant failure, thats where the knot guy resides. He cares. His providence is criticism and it takes form in a knowing expertise towards perceived flaws. But our freedom needs no patronizing. Our flaws need no parenting. Still, the knot guy cares. He cares with his passion and his empathy. That is what he has to offer and why we give him our sympathy.
