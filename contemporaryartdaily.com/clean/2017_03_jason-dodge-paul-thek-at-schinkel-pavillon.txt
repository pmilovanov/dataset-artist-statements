We are pleased to announce the final instalment of our exhibition series Porzellan und Vulkan with the exhibition Jason Dodge and Paul Thek. In the Schinkelklause several of Paul Thek’s major drawings will be displayed, while on the upper floor of the Schinkel Pavillon Dodge will present a sculptural installation. Dodges installative work and a program of poetry readings will draw conceptual reference to the work of Paul Thek and his engagement with rituals of diverse kinds.
The paralells between Thek and Dodge’s work in material and meaning are unmistakable. In addition to the visual exhibitions, the collaborations include readings by poets Dodge has published, and a workshop from Thek’s teaching notes for his 4D class at Cooper Union 1978-1981— all of these elements contribute to the interweaving between the artistic disciplines and embellish the notion of collaboration.

Paul Thek’s Newspaper Drawings, which he began in the late 1960s and continued until his death in 1988, form a crucial point of reference in his multifacious work.
Thek’s drawing series were the starting point for his extensive and walkable installations, in which perspective and movement built a substantial role. His interest in the visitors’ movement within the exhibition space is particularly valued at the Schinkel Pavillon as the octagonal architecture strengthens the installative character and interconnects succession and dialogue.
The Newspaper Drawings and Little Paintings reference an extensive installation by Thek which he presented at the New Yorker Brooks Jackson Gallery in 1980. Eighteen of the Little Paintings were hung in a dimmed room on the visitors eye level. By switching a light bulb on and off the viewer controlled the moment of contemplation – a reflection on image and space with which Paul Thek still influences current generations of artists.
