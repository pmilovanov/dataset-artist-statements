After exploring in depth the unique and extraordinary collection of the Glaskasten Museum of Sculpture in Marl, the New York-based artist Lena Henke (b. 1982 in Warburg, Germany) has put together a comic strip-style collage of photographs.
Henke’s whole photo series will be on exhibit at Marl’s Glaskasten Museum from Sunday, 27 April 2014 at 12 oclock. A selected motif from the series will also be featured in posters on large hoardings at various spots in town to put the people of Marl in mind of their local museum and what it has to offer.
