Kayu – Lucie Fontaine’s branch in Bali, Indonesia – is pleased to present its sixth project, “Domesticity VI”, a two-venue exhibition of international artists on view at Rumah Topeng Dan Wayang [The House of Mask and Puppet] in Bali and at Biasa Art Space in Jakarta, with the presentation of Arahamaiani’s performance as a parallel event of the Jakarta Biennale.
Inspired by the work of Mierle Laderman Ukeles – with whom Kayu will do a solo exhibition in the future – this project is the sixth iteration of a series of exhibitions previously presented in Prague, Stockholm, Miami, New York and Bali.
“Domesticity VI” continues to investigate the relationship – or lack thereof – between contemporary art and domestic spaces. In particular, “Domesticity VI” wants to challenge the social and political implications behind the notion of domesticity, which is traditionally connected to women through the reflection of the relation between host (the space, male, power) and guest (female). This iteration of the project is also informed by the Asian context; in Balinese culture, the woman is not only in charge with the household but also responsible for making offering to the Gods; furthermore in Japanese culture and specifically in the Japanese tea ceremony, the woman has a leading role and the ritual has long been entwined with issues of power embodied through the host-and-guest relation. Through these connections and the notion of offering, the exhibition would like to bring a unique group of artists to exhibit artworks as offerings – often produced with local artisans – within a temporary structure designed by Japanese architect Fumihiko Sano and inspired by Japanese teahouses.
