Carissa Rodriguez examines the material and social conditions in which art is produced and reveals how the canonical figure of the artist is reflected in—and reproduced by—the products of her labor.
Rodriguez’s solo exhibition at SculptureCenter will feature a newly commissioned video work. By engaging the discourse of sculpture through the tools of cinema, the video follows the lives of ‘related’ artworks and recounts the conditional relationships between artist, artwork, and third-party agents (institution, caregiver, surrogate) in familial terms. Through this work, Rodriguez investigates how techniques of modern reproduction—both artistic and biological—are organized around property and kinship structures that are mediated through technology and the law.
Carissa Rodriguez: The Maid is the artist’s first solo museum exhibition in New York City. The exhibition is curated by Ruba Katrib. The exhibition will travel to MIT List Visual Arts Center, Cambridge in spring 2018.
