Feuer/Mesler is pleased to present an exhibition of new work by Gretta Johnson. This suite of drawings by Johnson embodies multiple identities, pushing and pulling themselves between abstraction and figuration. The works float on the wallappearing as psychically driven icons and mutable cyborg bodies that speak to an ever present need to both assert and adapt. The works are engaged in a complicated play on desire, whether it is a luscious fur coat marred by noticeable absences or a writhing red-robed torso locked into a relaxed repose by the legs of a chair. These rigorously pressed and rubbed works on paper take on a psychological density while physically remaining nearly weightless. Gretta Johnson (b. 1985) received her BFA from Rhode Island School of Design. She lives and works in Brooklyn, NY. She has had exhibitions at Safe Gallery and Culture Room in Brooklyn and is currently a resident at The Lighthouse Works Fellowship on Fishers Island, NY.
