From June 20 till August 30, 2015, Vleeshal is presenting a solo exhibition by Cally Spooner (*1983, UK) and a group exhibition that runs parallel to and in dialogue with her show. It is the start of Roos Gortzak’s programming for Vleeshal.
On False Tears and Outsourcing is the first institutional solo exhibition by Cally Spooner in the Netherlands.
For her show, the artist will make a new series of devised, living gestures, which change every 3 weeks. The gestures mark the start of a long-term project by Spooner, which considers the violence of being used as, and using, a Human Resource. The project choreographs instances in which language and emotional excess are extracted, then redeployed as labour.
