First encounters of passionate resonance often arise in our seemingly tender, adolescent years. A time of self-exploration, the first refutation of societal expectation. Sensations of rebellion and impulsion. A riotous dichotomy ensues as the adolescent embraces new desires while adult society desperately attempts to impose forsaken innocence, non-consensually.
But in our rooms we play other games and at the dance our eager gropes are shrouded in smoke.
Take this Gum and Stick it, addresses this onset of hedonistic desire. Artworks put in place aesthetically contain a certain level of naivete; lace materials, the predominance of pink and imagery of a delicate or effeminate nature all contribute to a sense of innocence and nostalgia. In contrast, the thematic direction of the exhibition combined with the artworks themselves, play to varied sexual dialogues. Each work functions as an unapologetic declaration of primordial attraction or adolescent urges. In its entirety, the exhibition is an ode to that period in oneâ€™s life (particularly if that individual is queer or female) when sex is presented as sensitive subject matter. Yet, it diverges from this tactful bestowal, demands agency and takes it by the balls.
