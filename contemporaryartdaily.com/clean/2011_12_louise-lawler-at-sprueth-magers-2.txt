Sprüth Magers London is delighted to present an exhibition of new work by American artist Louise Lawler in her first UK solo show in four years. For the artist’s third exhibition at the London gallery, Lawler reveals a series of photographs presented as mounted prints and vinyl murals that have been stretched and adjusted to fit the gallery walls.
Louise Lawler’s artistic practice explores the presentation of artwork and the context in which it is viewed. In the 1970’s, Lawler began taking photographs of works of art, usually in situ at museums, auction houses, galleries and private homes. Concentrating on the way a work of art is handled, exhibited, stored or sidelined, Lawler’s work questions how art is modified by the manner in which it is displayed.
The exhibition will feature two sets of work entitled Civilian, 2010 and No Drones, 2010/2011 which depict two oil paintings by the German artist Gerhard Richter. Lawler photographed Richter’s Mustang-Staffel, 1964 and Schädel, 1983 in situ during the installation of the permanent collection at the Albertinum Museum, Dresden which re-opened in June 2010. At Sprüth Magers London, Lawler presents each photograph as a mounted cibachrome print. The same images have then been printed onto adhesive vinyl, the original dimensions manipulated to make them strictly proportional to the gallery walls. Through her playful and curious vantage points, Lawler encourages the viewer to explore the role of the gallery as a site for display and to question the extent to which art is distorted in the world.
