The Belgian artist Guy Mees has been a central figure of Antwerp’s art scene since the 1970s. For the first time in Austria, an exhibition is devoted to his work, rarely shown internationally.
Guy Mees’ photographs, videos, and above all his fragile paper-works characterize formal rigor combined with sensitivity and delicacy. He left behind an outstanding œuvre that transgresses geometric abstraction, minimal and conceptual art, kinetic and applied art. With emblematic work examples from creative phases between the 1960s and 2000s, supplemented by selected archive material from his estate, the exhibition emphasizes the continuing significance of the artist, who has recently become an important reference figure for a younger generation of artists.
