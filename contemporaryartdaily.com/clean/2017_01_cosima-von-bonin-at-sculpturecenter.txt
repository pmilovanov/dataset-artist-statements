Whos Exploiting Who in the Deep Sea?, Cosima von Bonins first solo museum exhibition in New York City, examines the German artists fascination with the sea. Commonly evoked in her works, but rarely made explicit, the ocean is an organizing thematic for this show that focuses on a selection of her sculptures from 2000 onwards.
Two opposing sides of the sea—a mysterious underworld with its beaches populated by sun-seeking vacationers—operate as metaphors in much of von Bonins work. Manifested through sculptures of creatures like crabs and sharks, as well as large bikinis and lifeguard stands, the exhibition investigates this conceptual thread.
Von Bonins cast of textile characters included in the exhibition present a host of contradictions—approachable creatures that arent quite what they seem or dont behave as we might expect. Weaving together humor with melancholy, softness with hardness, access and exclusion, von Bonins sculptures mix with art history, popular culture, music, and craft, while engaging in feminist destabilizations. Appropriately, the deep sea—where von Bonins crew ventures—is its own world, little known and remote for us.
Mary Messhausen, Oliver Husain, produzentin, and Simone Junker performed throughout the opening reception on Sunday, September 18, 2016.
Cosima von Bonin: Who’s Exploiting Who in the Deep Sea? is organized by Glasgow International and SculptureCenter, New York.
