If the practice of Pierre Huyghe (b. 1962, Paris) were a metaphysical equation, it could read: what is = +/– growth. Huyghe infects matter with memory, whether in the melodic voice of Lucie Dolène, the invented customs of a new town, or the biotope of psychoactive plants, a roaming dog, and bees returning to their hive on a statue’s head. His somethings—expediently called “art”—expose us to systems that grow and leak; they propel us beyond the known and towards what may be.
For this eighth season of The Artist’s Institute, we are in a process of thinking with Huyghe, becoming sensitive to the varying intensities of spiders, temperatures, rat songs, lectures, pheromones, texts, and time together. This dynamic embodied experience puts us under the influence of human and inhuman forces, and of fictions that may, over time, seep into reality and de-script what we thought we knew.
Suspending our need for a resolution, or even for an exhibition, we follow what emerges, day by day, from a basement beneath the street.
