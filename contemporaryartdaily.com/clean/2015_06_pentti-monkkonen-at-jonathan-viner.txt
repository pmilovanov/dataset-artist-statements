Iâ€™m dreaming dreams,
Im scheming schemes,
Im building castles high.
Theyre born anew,
Their days are few,
Just like a sweet butterfly.
And as the daylight is dawning,
They come again in the morning.
When shadows creep,
When Im asleep,
To lands of hope I stray.
Then at daybreak,
When I awake,
My bluebird flutters away.
Happiness new seemed so near me,
Happiness come forth and heal me.
Im forever blowing bubbles,
Pretty bubbles in the air.
They fly so high,
Nearly reach the sky,
Then like my dreams,
They fade and die.
Fortunes always hiding,
Ive looked everywhere,
Im forever blowing bubbles,
Pretty bubbles in the air.
