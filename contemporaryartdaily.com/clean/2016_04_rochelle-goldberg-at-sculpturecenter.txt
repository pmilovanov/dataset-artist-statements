Long Island City, NY – SculptureCenter is pleased to announce the first solo institutional exhibition by Rochelle Goldberg. Born in Vancouver, Canada, she is currently based in New York City.
Goldberg stages sculptural topographies composed of living, ephemeral, and synthetic materials, such as crude oil and chia seeds, in combination with ceramic and steel. Transformation is enacted through her continuously evolving terrains, and further represented through the hybrid impressions of synthetic snakeskin and fingerprints. Molting and shape shifting, Goldberg’s work challenges the fixity of the art object. For her exhibition at SculptureCenter, Goldberg is hand rendering human-scaled sculptures in ceramic and steel that are evocative of hybrid fish forms and other motifs, enacting a psychological narrative around our post-industrial age.
The exhibition will take place in SculptureCenter’s lower level galleries. It is curated by SculptureCenter curator Ruba Katrib and will be accompanied by a fully illustrated publication.
