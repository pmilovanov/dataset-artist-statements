The Discovery of a Leak in the Roof of Marcel Breuer’s Wellfleet Summer Cottage on the Morning of September 16, 1984 is a two-part exhibition, organized with Tyler Murphy, opening first at Off Vendome in New York on June 5, then in Provincetown, Massachusetts on August 7 at Commercial Street. The specificity of the fictionalized but potentially real scenario, a leak in the roof of Marcel Breuer’s cottage in 1984, serves as a truss for the show. By focusing on this specific moment, we hope to comment not only on the shortcomings of modernism but also on the inevitable effects of time on all things. Maybe it was discovered by the new owner of the house, a contractor, or has it been willed? We don’t know. What matters is that this person, at this moment, this fine September morning—as they often are on the Outer Cape at that time of the year—looks up and sees it. There’s a leak in the roof. It might still be wet, or it could just be a stain.
