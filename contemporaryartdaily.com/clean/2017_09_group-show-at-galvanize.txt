XYZcollective is pleased to announce “Do Sculptors Dream of Electric Car? ( Toyota Prius)“ at Galvanize Gallery, as a conjunction with Reborn-Art Festival 2017.
Dear Ishinomaki ,
We, XYZcollective, have collected ten pieces of sculptures from Tokyo and Los Angels. Then we loaded those sculptures in an electric car (Toyota Prius) and headed from Tokyo to Northern Japan. On the way, we stopped by Nasu Highland Highway rest stop and to Hamaguri (clam) Beach. Finally, we exhibited the works at Galvanize Gallery in Ishinomaki, Miyagi Prefecture .
