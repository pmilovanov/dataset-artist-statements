each: oil on canvas
These portraits of objects are encountered as symbolized vehicles, plainly art objects rather than paintings. The use of oil on canvas is a fast track to navigation of the object. The painting of the decoy behaves as a decoy, with both attraction and subterfuge —the lures bait and hook. Truffles are a rare find, sniffed out and coveted by connoisseurs. The glass shard irritant, similar to a grain of sand, embedded in the fleshly tongue of the oyster when nurtured and embraced evolves into a cultured worldly gem. The obsessive and possessive nature of a chew toy also speaks of a certain amount of substance to wrangle with.
And then there’s the Garnish.
