Misako &amp; Rosen is pleased to announce Chunk our fourth exhibition with Sao Paulo based artist Erika Verzutti.
With the works of Chunk, executed primarily in the media of papier mache, ceramic and rock clay, Erika Verzutti has developed her practice of creating “Pet Cemeteries” floor-based assemblages of salvaged fragments of art into wall-based works; Verzutti has repurposed these studio companions re-assembled and housed them in and on wall-mounted, quasi-relief structures. Citing a penchant for the non-industrial and the extended engagement that this generates, Verzutti emphasizes the material and narrative nature of her practice; no longer -cemeteries-, perhaps these new works are more akin to the reliquary.
