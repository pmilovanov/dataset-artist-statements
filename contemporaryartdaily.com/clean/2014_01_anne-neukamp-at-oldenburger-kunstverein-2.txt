The elements of Anne Neukamps are as autonomous as the paintings within which they are placed.
Reduced to only a few elements, her large-format oil, tempera and acrylic paintings show markings, symbols, shadowy figures and logos hovering in an apparent effortless, yet persistent, fashion within her works as complexly intertwined connections.
In the past the interaction of these abstract, strangely familiar shapes could be best described as the the stratification and superimposition of many tiers of color. This obscuring, scouring and layered painting reveals the significance of the paintings process.
In her earlier works the number of layers were reduced, resulting in an intensified representation of contrasts and opposites.
While abstracted characters and representational subjects enhance the effects of spatial illusion and simultaneously emphasize the plane of the canvas, empty spaces reveal themselves forging a rhythmically pulsating painting.
A selection of Anne Neukamps latest works will be presented in Oldenburg.
These works art leave us to reflect on upon the ‘origin’ and reference points of her way of regarding and organizing her multifaceted paintings.
Her accomplishments diverge from the traditional comprehension of images and text by asserting themselves and reminding us of the necessity of insight, query, and observation.
