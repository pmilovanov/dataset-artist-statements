Through these exhibitions De Hallen Haarlem wants to emphasise the importance of Daan van Golden (Rotterdam, 1936) and show in which way he inspires a younger generation of artists. Van Golden is a typical artistâ€™s artist, whose artistic views have particularly met with response among his colleagues. In recent years the international recognition for his work has soared: the large retrospective Red or blue for example was shown in London, Geneva and Lisbon. The exhibition in De Hallen Haarlem comprises a selection of his paintings and photographs spanning a period of 50 years.
Daan van Golden
His relatively small but diverse body of work is characterized by an acute attention to detail. References to important works from art history, as well as to less exalted images from commerce, pop-music and daily life are important components of his work. Van Golden has never been too concerned about prevailing artistic trends and has always carved a path of his own. His art does not consist of large brushstrokes, but of a much more modest gesture: his paintings are the result of a labour-intensive process, whereby a visual motive is explored in a very careful and precise manner.
