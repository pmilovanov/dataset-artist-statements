Lévy Gorvy’s first solo exhibition with acclaimed Conceptual artist and philosopher Adrian Piper, this focused presentation will include examples from the Mythic Being series (1973–1975), It’s Just Art (1980), and Here, an installation work conceived in 2008 and realized for the first time at the gallery. Together, these three bodies of work delve into interrelated themes Piper has explored throughout her career—the intersubjective formation of self, identity, race and gender; racism, sexism, xenophobia, and competing conceptions of political responsibility.

Over the course of six decades, Piper has tirelessly denaturalized cultural norms of visibility and communication, subjecting them to a trenchant, and potentially transformative, critique. This exhibition comprises a multimedia zone for acts of looking and being looked at, of identifying and being identified, to unfold in the here-and-now of what Piper terms “the indexical present.”
