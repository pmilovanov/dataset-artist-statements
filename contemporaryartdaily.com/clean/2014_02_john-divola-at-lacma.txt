As Far As I Could Get is the first solo museum presentation of the work of John Divola. The exhibition is a collaborative project led by the Santa Barbara Museum of Art, with different components shown simultaneously at SBMA, LACMA, and the Pomona College Museum of Art. LACMAâ€™s presentation includes Polaroid images of sculpted objects, serial works comprised of appropriated continuity shots and stereographs, and conceptual landscapes in which the artist himself appears in a performative role.
Divolas career spans four decades. After graduating from California State University, Northridge, he entered the MFA program at the University of California Los Angeles. There, under the tutelage of Robert Heineken, Divola began to develop his own unique photographic practice, one that merges photography, painting, and conceptual art. He also teaches contemporary art at the University of California, Riverside, and writes about photography.
