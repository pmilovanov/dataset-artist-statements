July 18 – October 14, 2017
Portikus is turning thirty. Founded as a small art space on Schöne Aussicht in 1987, we moved from there to the Leinwandhaus and then to the Maininsel. Portikus XXX is the name of our anniversary project that doesn’t look back, but simply keeps moving ahead, not inside Portikus itself, but in the city so important to Portikus: Frankfurt am Main. We leave our space and, with small gestures and major interventions, present new works in urban places that shape the cityscape. In this way, Portikus XXX addresses a broad audience while, at the same time, we continue to do what we’ve been doing in recent years: making exhibitions that stimulate, expand perspectives and ask questions.

What might a minor history of Portikus told through video look like? Helke Bayrle’s Portikus Under Construction gives this history its images, building an institutional memory and body of artworks out of what is almost always erased and obfuscated: work left outside of finalized and public-facing installations within the main gallery. Though the artworks in this screening program are by no means minor in and of themselves, they work outside of the limits of these artists’ previous contributions to the exhibitionary legacy of Portikus. Almost none of these films and videos have been shown within the galleries of Portikus before, yet they provide a vehicle for reflection through their addition and deviation. In an effort to let these relations permeate the methods of this program, groupings of films and videos will together assert the value of lack, the uncertain, the secondary, the obscured, the forgotten, and the unclassifiable. This project attempts to build a minor history of Portikus, inspired by Bayrle, from these foggy positions.

Shannon Bool Press Release:
July 19 – October 1,2017
Dom St. Bartholomäus
Domplatz 1
60311 Frankfurt am Main
In her work, Shannon Bool deals with the representational systems of art history with regard to visual and decorative arts and creates drawings, collages, photograms, murals and installations. In them, she often references related disciplines such as architecture, literature or psychology. For the Dom St. Bartholomäus (imperial cathedral), Bool has produced a new marble bench sculpture, which the artist has engraved with surface incisions oriented on historical church graffitis found in various archives. The work is complemented by a large-format tapestry reflecting the artist’s interest in ornaments, early modernism as well as oceanic cult. In this context, ornamental elements and different surfaces are not merely decoration, but bearers of meaning that reflect the complexity of perceptive and comprehension processes. Scribed Grid is a painterly work with a grid related to the structure of the windows in the cathedral, thus entering into a dialogue with the setting.

In 2011, students of Städelschule invited writer Mark von Schlegell to organise a fiction seminar in the school. Since then, the class, Pure Fiction, has brought together current and former Städel students to examine and above all produce texts in the most diverse forms possible, from written artistic works and experimental writing to readings and performances that inevitably draw in other aspects of the diverse artistic practices of all the class members. The works of authors from Cervantes to Woolf form the pre–given raw material of the seminar. An engagement with the material and mystical properties of printed matter have led the class to produce numerous publications. For Portikus XXX, Pure Fiction presents itself in two ways. Recurring texts can be seen on 116 digital screens throughout the Frankfurt Airport. The words are translated into moving images, which suggest a sequential interpretation and follow a general notion of word flow. The relationship between form and content is visually reduced by means of the typographic design. In addition, the Pure Fiction class will give readings: on three evenings, new and old texts will be presented.

Frankfurt Airport

ARTIST TALK
July 26, 2017, 21h
Portikus
Dara Friedman is best known for experimental, non-narrative works that deconstruct the techniques of conventional filmmaking. For Dancer (2011), she enlisted a variety of Miami-based dancers to move through the urban space. Shot on 16mm black-and-white film and transferred to HD video, Dancer celebrates both the city and the medium of dance. With the city streets as a stage, dancers improvise, expressing the specificity of their styles and making meaning through movement. Inspired partly by the late Pina Bausch (1940–2009) creator of the dance theater movement, Friedman – like Bausch is not necessarily interested in how people move, but rather, what moves them. Brief excerpts from the original 25-minute film, which shows some 60 dancers in about 40 scenes, will be presented on the monitors in Frankfurt Airport’s arrivals area. In this way, the travelers in front of the screens become dancers themselves. Through a careful crafting of the filming process, and reacting to the dancers’ bodies – Friedman transforms each participant from someone being passively watched to someone being danced with, a partner.

Anne Speier Press Release:
July 21 – October 1, 2017
Opening: July 20, 2017, 17–20h
Fleming’s Selection Hotel Frankfurt-City
Eschenheimer Tor 2
Bleichstraße 64–66
60318 Frankfurt am Main
In her work, Speier employs different techniques to deal with contemporary questions of art production. The intricacy of her work is reflected in the medium of the collage, which is processed digitally as an expression of the contemporary. The artist addresses her own location in the field of art as the subject of everyday situations. In a new sculpture, Anne Speier has created a primate that viewers encounter hanging from the ceiling. The pose of the orangutan suggests fear and a corresponding defensive stance. However, there is nothing signifying what else is going on in the room. Is the orangutan just imagining reasons for his posture? Is he pulling away from us visitors? As a work of art, the animal becomes the projection surface, which can play various roles in its attribution as a primate. Beyond pop culture references, Speier’s sculpture raises questions about identity – that of the object and our own confronted by it. The stairway becomes a stage, drawing attention to the sculpture and making it possible to see it from different angles. The rope can be read as a multi-story guideline.

The Attackables by Kerstin Cmelka as supporting film before selected screenings
Orfeos Erben
Hamburger Allee 45
60486 Frankfurt am Main
In her works, Kerstin Cmelka combines different media such as photography, video and performance with objects and creates extensive installations. Her works often reference plays, movies and TV shows, which she adapts and expands. They move at the interface between visual and performing arts, make use of traditional dramatic techniques and transfer them to the exhibition context. In many of her productions, Cmelka takes on the roles of director, screenplay writer, actor, as well as scenery artist and costume designer. A patchwork family, where the adults as well as the children are active as professional performers in contemporary fields of the arts industry and other services is at the center of her new portmanteau film The Attackables (Die Angreifbaren). They are protagonists of a socially undervalued profession: modern jugglers or carnies who coordinate their various activities and roles with great physicality, a high degree of concentration, pragmatics and professionalism, demonstrating less fame than ongoing work and flexibility in a wide variety of performative terrains. The first episode of Die Angreifbaren begins with performers heading to an extraordinary shoot on a frantic car ride, in which the other themes of the film are revealed. This part is both a teaser for the entire film project as well as an independent short film. Accordingly, The Attackables – Episode #1 will be shown at various cinemas in Frankfurt in the opening program before the main feature.

Peles Empire Press Release:
August 5, 2017
20h
Parkhaus Alt-Sachsenhausen
Upper parking deck
Walter-Kolb-Straße 16
60594 Frankfurt am Main
The artist duo Katharina Stöver and Barbara Wolff have been working together since 2005 under the name of Peles Empire, questioning categories like “original” and “reproduction” in their work. They borrow not just the name of the Romanian castle of Peles, but alienate it as part of their work. The historical structure, which unites different historic architectural styles in a collage-like manner, is always a reference point for the works, which often undergo a double translation of two- and threedimensionality, from object to image of it and back to sculpture. In addition, the aspect of hosting is part of the artistic practice of Peles Empire, who have created various spaces for dialogue and organized exhibitions with other artists in Frankfurt, London, Los Angeles, Cluj, Istanbul and Berlin. For Portikus XXX, Peles Empire return to Frankfurt where they started with salons and bar evenings. They are presenting a bar made of Jesmonite, a special material that the two artists have discovered for their work and reconceived as a form of expression.

Tobias Rehberger &amp; Rirkrit Tiravanija Press Release:
October 10 – October 14, 2017
Kleinmarkthalle
Hasengasse 5–7
60311 Frankfurt am Main
Tobias Rehberger works in a wide variety of media to create works and extensive installations at the crossroads of art, design and architecture. His works are difficult to categorize and are notable most of all for this diversity. Rirkrit Tiravanija grapples with social issues and his work often takes on the form of social happenings, finding expression, for example, in cooking events, readings or concerts. It is always about the participants, who become active parts of and help to shape the work of the artist. For Portikus XXX, the two artists are realizing a project that brings both of their practices into the forefront while working with local producers. Rehberger and Tiravanija will offer a limited edition of ceramics for sale in the Kleinmarkthalle this fall. Part of these ceramics will be a variety of dishes freshly prepared by the two artists from ingredients from the market.
Tobias Rehberger (*1966 in Esslingen am Neckar, lives and works in Frankfurt, DE)
Rirkrit Tiravanija (*1961 in Buenos Aires, AR, lives and works in New York, US; Berlin, DE and Chiang Mai, THA)
