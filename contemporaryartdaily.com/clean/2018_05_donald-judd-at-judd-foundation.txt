Judd Foundation is pleased to present 15 x 105 x 15, an exhibition of extruded aluminum works by Donald Judd on the ground floor of 101 Spring Street in New York.
Judd made the edition of 12 extruded aluminum works in 12 anodized colors in 1991, one of a series of three-dimensional works published by Edition Schellmann and documented in the catalogue raisonné Donald Judd: Prints And Works In Editions. The exhibition will present the works as a full set installed on both the floor and the walls, as per Judd, a configuration not previously realized. Extruded out of solid aluminum, these works are the only works by Judd designed and fabricated as single-piece extrusions
“The primacy of symmetry in art and architecture is not very definitive or restrictive because there are so many kinds, some very close to asymmetry, such as some of the numerical progressions that I use. Absolute symmetry is marvelous and it’s also marvelous when symmetry itself allows variation, when the logic of the situation causes or allows an approach to symmetry.”
The extrusion profile was designed by Judd as a logical division of symmetrical space. The complex form simultaneously open and closed, with each work in the dimensions of 15 x 105 x 15 centimeters. The colors of the works, ranging from black to turquoise to clear, were executed through the anodizing of the aluminum, an industrial process by which the color becomes part of the material.
