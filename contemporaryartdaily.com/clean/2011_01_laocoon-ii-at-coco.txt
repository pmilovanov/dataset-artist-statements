Evolving from Lessing‘s thoughts on the differences between painting and poetry, the exhibition tries to capture the decisive moment when the borders between image and language, text/sign and narration/process are crossed; when image and sign collide, being read and seen at the same time; when narration and process interfere and thereby relate to structures of reception and their translation into language.
After »Laocoon« (October 20 – November 21), »Laocoon II« is the attempt to create an exhibition narration through a second chapter by recontextualising, exchanging, and also incorporating new positions.
