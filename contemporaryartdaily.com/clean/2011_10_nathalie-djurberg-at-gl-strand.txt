The exhibition Snakes Knows it’s Yoga presents a major piece of work by the Swedish artist Nathalie Djurberg and her composer and fellow countryman Hans Berg. The exhibition in GL STRAND consists of both films and a comprehensive sculptural installation.
The exhibition displays three animations: Greed (2009), Untitled (2010), and Snakes Knows it’s Yoga (2010) among a plethora of exhibition cases filled with strange and unsettling characters. In the sculptures as well as in the films, the artist examines mans need for belief, submission and devotion. The exhibition has a wide gallery of characters consisting of plasticine puppets staged as meditating yogis, orthodox priests, flaggelants, fabulous monsters and naked women. In scenes of sexual and ritual submission and violence the artworks put focus on man’s search for meaning.
Nathalie Djurberg and Hans Berg have in the last few years gained international recognition for their claymation short films with an intense soundtrack. The claymation films are created with a very time consuming animation technique. Djurberg’s artistic universe draws on the classic fairy tales and childhood imagery, but are graphically violent and erotic. At the Venice Biennale in 2009, the couple won the prestigious Silver Lion for their work The Experiment.
The exhibition has been created in close cooperation with the artists, kestnergesellschaft Hannover and Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen, Rotterdam
