Friedrich Petzel Gallery is pleased to announce THE JUXTAPOSITION OF NOTHINGS, an exhibition of new works by Cologne-based artist Cosima von Bonin. This is her sixth solo exhibition in New York.
Cosima von Bonin is one of the most prominent artists of her generation. Her practice has always been multifaceted, incorporating a mixture of sculpture, installation, painting, textiles, performance, sound, and film. She continues to stretch the definition of an artist not only through her diverse material practice but also by assuming the roles of curator, critic and producer.
In her current exhibition at Friedrich Petzel Gallery, von Bonin presents fabric wall works accompanied by three new sculptures: a Pinocchio on a high chair, a street lamp smoking a cigarette, and a lazy rabbit as a sloth supine on a table. Von Bonins approach often has a collaborative element: she has organized numerous exhibitions and events with fellow artists, musicians and theorists. In this exhibition, soundtracks composed by Moritz von Oswald accompany the artworks. These compositions will be heard in pinpointed locations throughout the gallery.
Cosima von Bonin’s work was featured prominently at 2007’s documenta 12 in Kassel. Her exhibition ROGER AND OUT, curated by Ann Goldstein, at MOCA Los Angeles in 2008 was the artist’s first large-scale institutional survey in the United States. Von Bonin’s work has most recently been exhibited at the Kunsthaus in Bregenz followed by the Arnolfini in Bristol. Her upcoming solo exhibitions include the Kemper Art Museum in St. Louis, Mamco in Geneva and Museum Ludwig in Cologne.
The exhibition opens on Thursday, March 31st , with an opening reception from 6 to 8 pm, and will remain on view through April 30, 2011.
