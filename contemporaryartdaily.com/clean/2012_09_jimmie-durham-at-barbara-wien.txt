Jimmie Durham (* 1940) shows new texts and objects, which deal with the subject Too long and drawn out. It is the fourth solo exhibition in our gallery, for which Durham developed a thematical concept with new works.
The exhibition bases on diary-like texts about the occurrences during the last months. Durham travelled to Naples, Rome and Berlin, made a retrospective at MUHKA in Antwerp, an installation at the dOCUMENTA (13) and realised a sculpture on Luis Bu√±uel at the art fair in Basel. In his texts Durham deals with the travels and the immense work, which are connected with international art projects. In the poem From Arnsberg to Antwerp he tells about a six hours long rainy train ride through Germany and the Netherlands. The poem contains a list of the small villages he travelled through. The combination of the bad weather and the long traveltime let the journey seem to be endless. Other texts describe how to catch a crocodile (you give it an art magazine and it will instantly fall asleep) or tell about the exertions of daily travel and work.
From Naples Durham brought remnants of an old leather factory: snakeskins, a samplebook of crocodileskin, leather samples and belts. From other localities Durham shows a tree bark or curiosities he collected on his travels, e.g. a toilet coupon of the Deutsche Bahn or prophecy slips of chinese fortune cookies.
Durham connects these objects with the texts to assemblages and sculptures.
