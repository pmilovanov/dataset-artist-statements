Various Transmitters is a demonstration of artworks which in their procedure, form or subject matter involve some of the problems of transmission. Movement occurs across media and space, content and meaning gets funneled through different devices. A valve which finds and channels the material, a refinery. Medium as agent of lopsided quid pro quo. It is less a question of how to make something, rather of how to process something. Streaming, Leaking, Reflecting, Refracting, Sourcing, Absorbing or otherwise transmitting.
Many ins and outs. A texture of transmission with each object, host and technic as a kind of membrane, letting some things in and some things through.
