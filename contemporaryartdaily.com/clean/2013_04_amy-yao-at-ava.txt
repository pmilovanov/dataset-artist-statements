This audio visual installation sourced from my rendezvous in China includes a variety of distorted documentation and recordings that glimmer and shimmer. In an effort to dig deep and discover something about my identity, my roots, I traveled to China to see what’s there. I traveled back home to Los Angeles, California for my grandmother’s 90’s birthday to join my family in a stroll through Huntington Library’s newly built Liu Fang Yuan Chinese Garden. The absurd expectation that one discovers something about who they are from going back to place that is culturally related to one’s identity is as funny as the idea that the legs of a ladder should be covered up in racy silk stockings — where the foot treads up the steps to move up the ladder to financial success and social mobility. Yet these are rich, mine-like territories to explore what is real and meaningful. It’s a repetition, an alliteration.
The sound recordings emanating out the Boba Milk Tea speaker were recorded in Shanghai, China where Kyle Minogue is as popular as Bob Dylan and Cher in France, and where middle aged ladies dance to country western music in public art parks. Where Sanka instant coffee is offered as a popular alternative to drip coffee and lattes. Rich is the new exclusive, VIP, upper echelon, Do Not Enter. Where factories produce crystals that vibrate under electric nodes resulting in modern wireless communication. I seem to be missing something and representation is always inadequate. Is China scary or the future?
