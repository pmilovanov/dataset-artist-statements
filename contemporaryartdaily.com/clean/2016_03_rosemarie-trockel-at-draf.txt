Study #14 looks in depth at the work Oh Mystery Girl 3 (2006), a collage by German artist Rosemarie Trockel from the David Roberts collection, London. Four additional loaned works selected by Trockel are presented alongside to complement the piece. A new text by writer Matthew McLean studying Oh Mystery Girl 3 is commissioned for the project.
Based in Cologne, Trockel’s work has been highly influential since the 1970s, working with collage, sculpture, painting, video and performance to address feminism, female identity, sexuality and the human body. She has been the subject of numerous solo exhibitions including Moderna Museet, Stockholm; MoMA, New York; the Dia Center for the Arts, New York; Whitechapel Gallery, London; Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris; Serpentine Gallery, London; New Museum, New York and the ICA, Boston. Trockel represented Germany in the 1999 Venice Biennale, and participated in documenta in 1997 and 2012.
The exhibition Study #13. Every Word Unmade, Fiona Banner is concurrently on display in DRAF Gallery.
DRAF Studies are a series of focused case-studies of works from the David Roberts Collection. Each presentation centres on a single work, displayed on its own in a gallery with a printed booklet. The commissioned writer studies the work in depth: from its techniques, origin and history to its position in the artist’s practice and contemporary debates. Previous Studies include works by Victor Man, Carole Bove, Bruce McLean, Martin Boyce, Boyle Family, Michael Simpson, Yto Barrada, Sterling Ruby, Ida Applebroog, Andreas Slominski, Etel Adnan and Phillip Guston.
