all i want to do
is sit on a beach
and write haiku
once again
staring
at a screen
sun rises
sun sets
repeat
Postmasters is very pleased to present a show of haiku wall paintings by Rafaël Rozendaal. Catching a daily moment, freezing a thought, a shortcut from one brain to another, easily transferable raw data, truly mobile, universal and indestructible, haikus are an essence in text. Artifacts deteriorate, but words are forever. 
Rozendaal’s art, be it his websites, his lenticular paintings, his installations, or his animations, are always about focus, locating an essence of a thought or an image. For this show all it takes is a color and a font.
Like www.muchbetterthanthis.com, his current installation in Times Square, where a simple, minimal animation of a kiss transcends its frenetic surroundings for the fleeting three minutes before midnight, Rozendaal’s haiku rise above the noise and chaos of contemporary art. 
“It’s a joy to write them, so little trouble, just an idea,” he says, I find comfort in simplicity its an escape.
The exhibition is accompanied by a $10 book of almost one hundred haiku.
