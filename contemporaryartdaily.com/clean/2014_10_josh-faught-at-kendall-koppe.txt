Kendall Koppe is delighted to present I know I came into this room for a reason, by Josh Faught. This is Faught’s first solo exhibition in the UK.
Conflating personal and collective histories in response to the history of textiles, Faught’s work hinges on investigating notions of support, transition and the passage of time, with specific interest in the emergence of two-sided weave structures in the 19th century known as ‘Double Weave’ and ‘Summer and Winter’. These reversible structures, used in colonial coverlets, produced a patterned cloth, white on one side and blue on the other-in essence, seasonally appropriate all year round. Faught’s work considers how these objects perform in both functional and narratives capacities, as both text and textiles, extending narratives around anxious decoration, displaced social codes, and material constructions of self.
Articulated through a series of wall and floor works, the exhibition forges a connection between a found type-written document outlining methods of domestic mould control, and the fashion forecast palette of 2014. Rules of sartorial aesthetic organisation operate as a foil to address other temporal/seasonal concerns and disappointments; allergies, wearing expired colours, a much-belated gift, or donning white shoes after Labor day. These irritants often force us into states of isolation and containment.
I know I came into this room for a reason invokes a space somewhere, suspended in time a place to situate work. It invokes a space one enters with conviction, purpose or urgency as well as one tinged with ambivalence and absent mindedness.
