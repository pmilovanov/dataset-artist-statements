 

This is the first mid-career survey of works by Brazilian artist Rivane Neuenschwander (b.1967, Belo Horizonte, Brazil), and will spotlight Neuenschwander’s unique contribution to the narrative of Brazilian Conceptualism, as well as the expanded field of her highly individualized practice. Neuenschwander merges painting, photography, film, sculpture, immersive installations, and participatory actions.
Her authorship is primary, but she also functions as an editor, collaborator, social organizer, and commissioning agent. Motifs that repeat with regularity include mapping, measuring, colonization, and categorization. Selected works in the exhibition will include maps exposed to equatorial rains as they morph into exquisite geographical fantasies; an immersive installation that investigates paranoia in an age in which privacy is no longer an individual’s natural right; and collages of constellations created with confetti made from Arabian Nights books, organized into a calendar that will reflect the length of the exhibition; among many other works on view. The show will span the third and fourth floor galleries and will be accompanied by a catalogue documenting the exhibition, along with essays by Richard Flood; Paulo Herkenhoff, Director, Museum of Fine Arts, Rio de Janeiro; Lars Bang Larsen, curator; Jasmil Raymond, Curator, DIA Art Foundation; and Rachel Thomas, Senior Curator and Director of Exhibitions at the Irish Museum of Modern Art. The exhibition is organized by the New Museum in collaboration with the Irish Museum of Modern Art, and is curated by Richard Flood, Chief Curator at the New Museum. After its New York debut at the New Museum the exhibition will travel to three other US venues, and will conclude at the Irish Museum of Modern Art.
