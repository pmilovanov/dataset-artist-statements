Wallspace is pleased to present Tunnels and Lighthouses, our second solo exhibition with Prague-based artist Jiří Kovanda.
Jiří Kovanda is one of the most important conceptual artists living in the Czech Republic. Widely known for his performances and installations that began in the mid-1970s, Kovandas practice is rooted in the poetics and theatrical potential of everyday actions and objects.
For Tunnels and Lighthouses, Kovanda will present a series of new collages, a medium he has consistently worked in since the late 1970s, as well as a site- specific installation inspired by and made with common, economical materials plants, rugs, flashlights found in New York. Says Kovanda: Cheap and simple things can sometimes turn out to be important and extraordinary, while expensive objects can be invisible.
In addition to the installation and collage works, Kovanda will create a group of collaborative, sculptural works with New York-based artist Silvina Arismendi. Arismendi and another New York-based artist, Anna Adler, will also participate in a performance conceived by Kovanda on the night of the opening: Two dark-haired girls one from Montevideo, the other from Moscow bring light into the darkness.
Kovanda’s work is currently on view in New York as part of Report on the Construction of a Spaceship Module at the New Museum. He was the subject of a retrospective at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Wroclaw this past November. Recent solo exhibitions include: Dos Anillos Dorados, Museo Nacional, Centro de Arte, Palacio de Cristal, Reina Sofia, Madrid (2012); The Nervous System (with Zbyněk Baladrán), Kunstverein, Milano (2011); White Blanket, Secession, Vienna (2010).
