We are inviting four artists to build individual sets for which their work will serve as installations to host other artists’ works as well as their own.
This idea plays with the mythos of Los Angeles as a place where the imaginary often extrudes into reality and vice versa.
Visually, the different “sets” so to speak, will be autonomous islands of light within an otherwise darkened space, to simulate a cinematic effect and the sense of being on a movie set. In many ways, we are inspired by the work of William Leavitt who recently had a retrospective at MOCA here in Los Angeles, and whose work often uses plays and their stages to beautifully reveal the mundane theatri- cality of the city. He told us once that his plays were really elaborate frames for his paintings.
In these sets, there is no presumption of verisimilitude. They may look like a soap opera living room or a phantasmagoric alter-reality. This, as with all art, is up to the artists.
