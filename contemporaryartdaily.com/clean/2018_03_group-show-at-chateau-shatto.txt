In Italo Calvino’s Castle of Crossed Destinies, knights meet at a table d’hôtes, but when they attempt to tell tales of their adventures, words mysteriously fail them. They then resort to a game of tarot. As each card is drawn, the knights give them meaning and reveal their stories. Forgive us, as it is the simple pleasure of the reference and the beauty of the title which makes us gather these four artists under the famous oulipian (inverted) banner.

Statement: 
Monday, February 12th, the day before Mardi Gras, Jef Geys left us and we are sad.
We are sad but we are happy to have known him and proud of our collaboration.
With his customary intensity he has created new works for the exhibition Le Destin des Châteaux Croisés currently on view at Château Shatto in Los Angeles; With his usual humour he added a big cow to Le Tour de France 69 d’Eddy Merckx at Air de Paris in Paris (cur. Sylvie Boulanger and Francis Mary); With his regular precision he has been actively involved in the preparation of two important exhibitions, respectively at Yale Union, Portland, USA (cur. Nicolas Tammens, from 14 April 2018) and at MAC’s Grand Hornu in Belgium (cur. Francis Mary, from April 29, 2018).
Dag Jef.
