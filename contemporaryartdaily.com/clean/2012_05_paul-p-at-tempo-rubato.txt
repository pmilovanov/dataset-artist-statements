Placing a diffuse focus on the romantic presence of his subjects, Paul P. is known for intimate renditions of seaside landscapes and nonchalant young males in suggestive postures. P.’s imagery is at once seductive and distanced, personal and contemplative, impressionistic and loose. With a palpable flair for Whistler’s haze and aesthetics admittedly at the foreground, his practice belongs to a pre-digital era without precluding contemporary references and abstraction.
On the occasion of his first exhibition in Israel, P. is proposing a homogeneous ensemble of works in two intertwined yet distinct groups: 16 small-sized ink drawings ranging from figuration to abstraction depicting Venetian balconies and architectural details, elusive Los Angeles seashores at dusk or dawn and statuary from Parisian gardens. Hung against walls painted in light hues of yellow or grey, they are presented in combination with 3 custom-made pieces of furniture inspired by the aesthetics of the British Design Reform, particularly as manifested in the oeuvre of designer E.W. Godwin.
This new body of work shall further assert P.’s shift from realistic erotic male representation and emphasize his current interest in abstraction, while retaining the identifying aspects that have characterized his work to date. Extending into the three-dimensional realm will constitute a pivotal moment in P.’s practice and lay ground for further experimentation with what he terms “a strong impulse to address the physicality of the exhibition space.”
Paul P. (b. 1977) lives and works in Paris, France.
P. has exhibited worldwide since 2003. Previous solo exhibitions were held at Thaddaeus Ropac Gallery (Paris and Sazburg, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2009), Daniel Reich Gallery (New York, 2003, 2007, 2010), Maureen Paley (London, 2008), and Marc Selwynn Gallery (Los Angeles, 2004, 2006, 2008, 2011).
