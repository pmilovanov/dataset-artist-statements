Two-person shows followed the same year at Leo Castelli Gallery in New York (with Peter Young) and at Carmen Lamanna Gallery, Toronto (with Brice Marden), and three years later with Cy Twombly, at Hampshire College, Massachusetts.
His work was included in Konrad Fischers show Prospect 73 at Städtische Kunsthalle, Düsseldorf. He presented work in High Times Hard Times, New York Painting 1967-1975 at ZKM, Karlsruhe, earlier this year.
