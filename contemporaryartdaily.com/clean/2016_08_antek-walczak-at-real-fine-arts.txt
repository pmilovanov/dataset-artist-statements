From 1996 until 2003, beginning in New York and ending in paris, Antek Walczak engaged in a film-making practice that was effectively brook-ended by The BC Corporate Story and Get Rid of Yourself, two important Bernadette Corporation films that helped expand an identity beyond its roots in nineties downtown club culture and fashion. Working simultaneously under his own developing consistency as a filmmaker in terms of thinking, shooting, and editing in a hybrid style built upon platforms central to arty film students and film studies programs of the 20th century: namely, the narrative-performative strains of sixties American underground film and the essay-tract forms embedded in postwar European cinema (Warhol x Godard).
The exhibition Films 1998 2000 presents four rarely screened works made and signed by Antek Walczak. Dynasty, Paris From Behind, Run With Zeros, Risques du metier (Risky Business) will be shown together as a roughly 120 minute program cycling three times daily on a 55 flatscreen TV in the gallery, with seating provided. Program details will be posted on the Real Fine Arts website.
