PRAXES Center for Contemporary Art is a not-for-profit venue for international contemporary art and research in Berlin. Situated in a two-story 200 m2 former community building, PRAXES presents half-year cycles of consecutive exhibition modules, papers, and live activities revolving around two unassociated artistic practices. For the inaugural exhibition cycle spanning Autumn 2013, PRAXES presented two parallel strings of exhibitions by GERARD BYRNE (Dublin/Copenhagen) and JUTTA KOETHER (Berlin/New York).
Gerard Byrne uses photographic, video, and live art to explore the ambiguities inherent in revisiting the legacies of cultural forms such as theater, photography, and magazines. Engaging ideas of episodic patterns and the temporality of reconfiguration—found throughout Byrne’s practice—the extended duration of display at PRAXES is announced in a timetable that loosely references, directs, and annotates the shifting works on show. Organized as a reverse chronological journey, the timetable soon reveals itself as a scripted gesture of staged surprise encounters and performed interpretations—as is often the case in Byrne’s transformation of historical sources. The cycle at PRAXES is the first extensive exhibition of Byrne’s work in Berlin.
