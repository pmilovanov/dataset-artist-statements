Very disappointed in this place. The pictures looked like a bargain! It looks clean and cozy, however, upon arrival it was very dusty, the appliances were rusty, and it just looked like it wasnt cleaned from the previous occupants. The wall had chipped paint, and the toilet looked disgusting. I wasnt aware I had to climb 6 flights of stairs to get to this disappointing flat. And to make matters worse, the shower was clogged, which was the final straw. I left 2 days early and checked into a hostel, it was that bad. Although not mandatory, but certainly would have been a kind gesture and something all other hotels/hostels Ive been to in the past has provided it would have been nice to have been left a map or things in the surrounding area. Im sure Aristidis means well, however, I would try my luck elsewhere.
