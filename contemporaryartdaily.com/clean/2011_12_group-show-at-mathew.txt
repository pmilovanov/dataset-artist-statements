David Lieske and Peter Kersten are pleased to announce the opening of Mathew, a new gallery located at Schaperstrasse 12, next door to the space formerly occupied by the Berlin gallery Ren√© Block from 1966 to 1979, which exhibited artists such as Joseph Beuys, Marcel Broodthaers, Robert Filliou, Richard Hamilton, Allan Kaprow, Nam June Paik, Sigmar Polke, Gerhard Richter, and Dieter Roth.
Lieske and Kersten co-founded the electronic music label Dial Records in 1999. Mathew will thus serve as an umbrella for their activity both as music producers and as gallerists. Occupying both positions in the label owner/musician and gallerist/artist dyads, Lieske will continue to make both music and art. As an artist, he is represented by Corvi Mora (London).
With a program generated exclusively through personal recommendations, Mathew is currently showing Robin Bruch, Michael Callies, Enzo Camacho, Merlin Carpenter, Nicholas Ceccaldi, Michaela Eichwald, Timothy Furey, Manuel Gnam, Ken Okiishi, Sergej Jensen, Amy Lien, Wols, Nick Mauss, Monika Michalko, Sprinkles, Jochen Schmith and Mathew Sova.
Mathew is named after an assistant who was fired from his gallery job in New York several years ago.
