A Personal Sonic Geology gathers together the films realised by Mathieu Copeland and Philippe Decrauzat since 2012. Stemming from a desire to film sound, record places, and dive into the process of a material construction and destruction, these films are screened using a projection apparatus that integrates an exhibition of monochrome screens/paintings.
Invited to create a programme and events and exhibitions at le Plateau from march 2014 on, Mathieu Copeland and Philippe Decrauzat have each time used these spaces and this time to involve artists from the visual and music fields—using the exhibition format, or he denser format of the event—and film, their end purpose being to pursue their film collaboration to present to the eye and ear, in the form of an immersive arrangement, something that has already been seen, heard and experienced.
Creating a dialogue between filmed images, painting and sound production, these films bring together a constellation of artists, superimposing and fragmentating the 16 mm film stock. Filming musicians including Alan Licht, Ellen Fullman or FM Einheit as they realise the soundtrack for these films to be, creating a dialogue between works of art and the camera, with Marcia Hafif’s drawings or a painting by Peter Halley, filming moments and places of creation such as the realisation of a painting by John M Armleder, the re-enactment of a lecture-demonstration by Gustav Metzger, Swiss artist and “researcher” Emma Kunz’s Grotto, and production sites including a printing press in Marrakech, a textile manufacture or a paint factory, the film’s components shape a linear assemblage of overlaid realities.
This programme has been the subject of a series of manifestos drawn up guests artists, lending each exhibition and event its title and thus connecting all the elements of the project, like links in one and the same huge enselmbe, offering us a re-reading of a history of modernity seen through visual arts and music.
