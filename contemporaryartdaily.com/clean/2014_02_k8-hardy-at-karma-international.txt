Karma International is happy to present the first solo show of New York based artist K8 Hardy (*1977, Fort Worth, Texas). This show, titled Bargain, is the first time the artist combines photography and sculpture from different periods.
At first glance the exhibition seems to transform the gallery space into a chic boutique. A neon sign with a woman’s hand holding a colorful handbag uses the visual language of advertising. Yet the materials used – cheap glue-on fingernails, the pattern of a fake Louis Vuitton bag contradict the idea of luxury and fashion. So does the writing on the light box: instead of advertising fashion it advertises K8 Hardy herself. The sculptures, lit by colorful disco lights, recall the commercial mannequin and emphasize the theatrical experience of shopping. They too are made with found and used materials.
The transformation of fashion and advertising, call our own personal role in mass consumption into question. The life-size self-portraits reference Hardy’s infamous performance at the last Whitney Biennial, Untitled Runway Show. They are at once a fake advertising campaign, and an analysis of the ever-present Selfie. The small prints go further to deconstruct our internet self-obsession, using collage techniques with the screens and devices that mitigate our consumption. The negative is edited multiple times by analogue and digital cut up techniques and then rearranged into a new motive.
Contra-cyclical to the selfie-phenomenon promoted by Instagram and Facebook, Hardy recently moved on and transferred the idea of posing and corporeal representation into a more abstract level. Shaking off the necessity of the artists presence as a model, they take on their own character and their own poses. Headless, skinny and a bit full of themselves the wood constructions bathe in the colorful light in the gallery. Their flirtatious and bizarre appearance seem very alluring. Who can resist them advertising a really good Bargain?
