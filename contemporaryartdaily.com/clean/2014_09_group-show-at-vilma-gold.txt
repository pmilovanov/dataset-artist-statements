The exhibition Nuclear War: What’s in it for you? is organised as a mis-en-scenes reflective of the differing political and aesthetic positions taken in the seventies and eighties and leading up to the fall of the Berlin wall. Work by KP Brehmer and Ludmila Seefried-Matejkova who were active in West Berlin during that time period are presented along side Suzy Lake’s Boundaries series from 1985 and which were made in reaction to her disillusionment with the social activism she was involved in while working with the Sandinistas in Nicaragua. Finally a Gaylen Gerber installation which includes a work by Will Benedict leads us out into a brave new world of night clubbing.
