Konrad Fischer Galerie is pleased to announce a presentation of new works by Zon Ito (born 1971) and Ryoko Aoki (born 1973, the couple lives and works in Kyoto). His sensitive embroidery on large scale tapestries and fabric establish Zon Ito as one of the most interesting artists working in Japan. With nervous, delicate lines of stitches the artist blends landscapes, animals and portraits into strange and playful hallucinatory scenes.
Together with his partner Ryoko Aoki, Zon Ito arranges installations including distinct works by both artists: embroidered pieces, little clay sculptures, drawings and videos merge into a perfect unity. References and sources of these works are found both in traditional Japanese arts like shodo calligraphy, kimono embroidery, or in the hand scrolls of the Kamakura period as well as in contemporary youth culture like manga and anime.
Ito and Aoki have exhibited, in many museums and institutions such as: Mori Art Museum, Museum of Contemporary Art and WATARIUM at Tokyo, Kyoto Art Center, Musée d’art moderne de la Ville de Paris, Centre d’art contemporain Fribourg (Switzerland), Walker Art Center, UCLA Hammer Museum, at documenta 12 and at Yokohama Triennial of Contemporary Art.
