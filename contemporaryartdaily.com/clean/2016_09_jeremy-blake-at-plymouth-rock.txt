Plymouth Rock announces Jeremy Blake: A Survey, the first exhibition to approach this highly influential artists full career. From 1997 until his death, at the age of 35, in 2007 Blake merged digital art, photography and painting into dense c-prints and animations that combined abstracted imagery and content with the powers of each medium. Exploring the mythology of the American West and West Coast, as well as the enduring legacy of American abstraction he was a trailblazer that helped define nascent new medias.
During his lifetime, Blake was included in three Whitney Biennials in a row and had numerous major museum solo exhibitions including at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art and the Reina Sofia in Madrid. His work is included in the permanent collections of many museums including the Museum of Modern Art, Whitney Museum of American Art, Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles and the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art.
The exhibition includes ‘digital c-print paintings’ and digital videos, what Blake referred to as ‘time-based paintings’, from 1998 to 2004.
This is the first career survey of Blake’s work, the first time his work has been exhibited in Switzerland since 2002 and the first time work has been exhibited in Europe since the artist’s death.
