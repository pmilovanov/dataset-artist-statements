Marc Kokopeli’s exhibition Tales of the Veil expands the themes approached in his first solo exhibition in New York. This time, the artist decided to dress the three walls, which were previously presented with only white fleece. Independent downtown fashion’s relation to the science fiction that we watch and live through concurrently serves as inspiration for the drapery. These Post-Baroque stylings inform the exhibition with questions about the circularity of references to the fable of becoming an artist.
