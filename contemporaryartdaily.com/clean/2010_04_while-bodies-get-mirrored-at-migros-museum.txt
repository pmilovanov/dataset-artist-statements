This group exhibition brings together works that thematise the relation of tension between movement and space, and in so doing take up and reactivate a formalist vocabulary of signs. One focus of the exhibition is the influence of (post) modern dance and choreography in contemporary art. Another central theme is the re-presentation of the performative, and the notation of movement and dancerly activities through the most varied media, ranging from classical photography and the filmic through to the sculptural and installative.
