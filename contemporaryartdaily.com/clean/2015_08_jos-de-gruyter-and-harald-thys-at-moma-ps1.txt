The exhibition Jos de Gruyter and Harald Thys: Fine Arts presents new and existing work by the Belgian artists Jos de Gruyter (b. 1965) and Harald Thys (b. 1966). Featuring fifteen steel sculptures, more than eighty watercolors, and several videos, it will be the artists’ first museum exhibition in New York City. The artists make tragic, comic, and silent portraits of the human condition. They are drawn to all that society can’t digest or domesticate, and they create a perverse caricature that is populated by amateur actors, faces, dolls, animals, and other speechless objects. Their work is deadpan, in all senses of the word: funny and blank at the same time.
Standing at nine-feet tall but eight millimeters thick, the sculptures resemble cut-out figures or pixelated bodies. Watercolored faces, traced from anonymous images found online, are pinned to each one. Appearing throughout a series of eight carpeted galleries, the sculptures will be the visitors to an exhibition of new watercolors. This series of eighty-four watercolors depict the lives and rituals of groups all over the world and a new film, Die aap van Bloemfontein (The Ape from Bloemfontein, 2014), relates a story of impossible and exuberant transformations—a computer becoming a lawnmower becoming a television.
Jos de Gruyter (b. 1965) and Harald Thys (b. 1966) have collaborated since the late 1980s. They have had numerous solo exhibitions at institutions including Kunsthalle Wien, Vienna; M HKA, Antwerp; Kunsthalle Basel; Culturgest, Lisbon; and were included in the Venice Biennale (2013) and the Berlin Biennial (2008). Raven Row, in London, will present a solo show in September 2015. De Gruyter and Thys live and work in Brussels.
