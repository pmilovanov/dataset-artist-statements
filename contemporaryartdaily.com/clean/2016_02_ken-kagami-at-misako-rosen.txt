As titled, this exhibition is about Dog(s); however in the exhibition viewers will not see an actual dog. By presenting the point of view of the family pet, Kagami will at the same time reveal the true feelings of dogs as well as his genuine affection for the animal. In present times, dogs are considered a member of the family. The dog as pet acts a s a healing member of the family and is meant to spend a peaceful lifetime together with its members. But, are the dogs that you see everywhere in Tokyo actually happy? Also, are dogs which are overly styled by humans really happy? Kagami will consider these questions with his usual sense of black humor.
