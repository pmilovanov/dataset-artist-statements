For more than fifty years, Ken Price, born in 1935 in Los Angeles, California, created remarkable and innovative works that have redefined contemporary sculpture practice. Price procured a cult following among critics and scholars since the 1960s, including Lucy Lippard, who declared in 1966, “It is a fact rather than a value judgment that no one else, on the east or west coast, is working like Kenneth Price.” Price’s work has been much talked about, though not widely exhibited until relatively recently (and then only in group shows or in commercial gallery presentations). Ken Price Sculpture: A Retrospective traces the development of Price’s sculptural practice from his luminously glazed ovoid forms to his suggestive, molten-like slumps, positioning him within the larger narrative of modern American sculpture. This sculptural retrospective honors the late artist’s creativity, originality, and revolutionary art practice.
Architect Frank O. Gehry, who enjoyed a friendship with Price of almost fifty years, is designing the exhibition. A fully illustrated catalogue includes essays by Stephanie Barron (exhibition curator) as well as art historians and critics Phyllis Tuchman and Dave Hickey, and an extended interview with the artist by MaLin Wilson Powell.
