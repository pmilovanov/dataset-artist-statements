Yvon Lambert is pleased to present an exhibition of new work by Los Angeles based artist Kaz Oshiro. The exhibition opens with a reception for the artist on Wednesday, October 28, 2009 from 6-8 pm and will be on view until December 23, 2009.
For his second solo exhibition at Yvon Lambert Kaz Oshiro will show a variety of works made from acrylic on stretched canvas, including speaker cabinets, rectangular gray scale boxes, large metal garbage bins, and abstract still-lifes. Oshiro constructs and paints canvas in three dimensions to create his paintings, and all are rendered as the same size as the objects after which the works are modeled.
Oshiro’s works are replete with visual intrigue in that the artist’s representations are astonishingly realistic. Commonplace items, not traditionally considered beautiful or to have visual value, are imbued with new life through Oshiro’s trompe l’oeil style. In depicting mundane objects, at first glance the artist strips the artwork of its artistic aura. Devoid of any haughty artistic assumptions, Oshiro’s works are based on familiar objects, the value of which initially seems nominal, yet their visual intrigue forces the viewer to rethink the work.
The three-dimensionality and realism of the works create a conundrum for the viewer, who is forced to address the tension between facade and reality. Oshiro openly displays the secret behind his work: the back of the canvas on its stretchers is visible to the viewer. Oshiro takes the abstract nature of minimalist concept and creates paintings that exist in between abstract and realism, pop and minimalism, and sculpture and painting.
Kaz Oshiro was born in 1967 in Okinawa, Japan and emigrated to the United States in 1986. He completed his Bachelor and Master of Fine Arts degrees at California State University, Los Angeles and has exhibited in the United States and abroad including: the Asia Society and Museum, New York; UCLA Hammer Museum, Los Angeles; Las Vegas Art Museum.
