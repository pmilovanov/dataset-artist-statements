Andreas Schulze is one of the most interesting German painters of his generation. He creates artificial worlds filled with apparently ordinary everyday objects in his distinctive spatial installations and large-format, vividly colored paintings. Tables, chairs, wing armchairs; potted plants, porcelain, colorful blankets; wooden beams, buttons, and peas – besides the amorphous and spiral-shaped objects, these are the protagonists in his deserted, unreal pictures. The artist, born in 1955, has developed a large-format, extensive new wall painting especially for the Rotunda of the Schirn. Beginning on September 18, Schulze’s “Pea Roads” will span a total of 400 square meters on two floors. For his new work, the painter stylizes the eponymous peas, which time and again populate his pictures, to roughly two thousands fluorescent circles whose monumentality and complexity create the impression of being a network of streets from a bird’s-eye view. This impression is heightened further when it is dark and the peas begin to glow – to the viewer, the “Pea Roads” seem like nighttime satellite images of an urban infrastructure. Applied to a violet, anthracite, white background, the peas appear to flow from one floor into the other like meandering water. The round structure seems to be the ideal venue for Schulze, who often plays with views from inside and outside in his oeuvre and frequently works with perspectives through windows and interiors. In the early 1980s, Schulze achieved national and international recognition for his unconventional and multifaceted style of painting, and he is highly regarded by both critics as well as artists for his cryptic and sometimes bizarre works. His pictures stand out not only due to their surreal and ironic features, but also due to their enormous size and recurring motifs. Besides paintings, he produces entire interiors and combines genres such as sculpture and painting.
