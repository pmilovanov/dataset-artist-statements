Ida Ekblads practice incorporates painting and sculpture but also poetry, filmmaking and performance. The Norwegian artist has collaborated with multiple artists and musicians. Her sources of inspiration include artist figures such as Odilon Redon, Joy Orbison, Lina Bo Bardi, the acting of Gena Rowlands and the writing of Haldis Moren Vesaas and Inger Hagerup.
Her high-energy paintings are superabundant, retinal, corporal, pushy and highlight trends and techniques often seen as outdated or even tacky such as puffy paint, rose pattern kitchen towels, run-of-the-mill graffiti, steam punk, b-girl aesthetic or airbrushing. Colors work as both decor and aggressor, forced onto the canvas and combined with the mysterious and druggy poetry of her titles.
A sense of freedom exudes from the vibrant work of Ekblad who dislikes to plan, organize, rationalize or iron things out. Ekblad rather looks for hunchy moments of peak eyes, peak ears, peak everything when working.
