SculptureCenter is pleased to announce Erika Verzutti will present a new body of sculptures and images in her first solo exhibition in New York City. Working between synthetic and organic materials, Verzutti creates hybrid objects and situations that interrogate relationships between forms and bodies.
The centerpiece of the exhibition, a twelve-foot-tall abstract swan sculpture, functions as monument, character, and stage. Enclosed by a group of black and white photographs, the sculpture is not only a prop, but also a co-star in some kind of a play that has taken place. The images feature an actor and the swan snapped in various moments of drama and comedy, never culminating in a complete narrative.
Verzutti’s exhibition is primarily composed of new works, including Swan with Stage and the related photographic series. In addition Verzutti has remade several of her bronze works, incorporating the color blue in each revision. Blue is an arbitrary color choice, although the decision to include it is deliberate. Sharing blue in common, the color creates its own variation, operating differently on each sculpture, becoming more distinct through its comparison.
Verzutti (born 1971 in São Paulo, Brazil) is based in São Paulo and has had solo exhibitions at the Tang Museum at Skidmore College, Saratoga Springs, NY (2014) and the Centro Cultural São Paulo, Brazil (2013). Group exhibitions include the 56th Carnegie International, Carnegie Museum of Art, Pittsburgh (2013), the Mercosul Biennial, Porto Alegre, Brazil (2013), and the 11th Biennale de Lyon, Lyon, France (2011).
