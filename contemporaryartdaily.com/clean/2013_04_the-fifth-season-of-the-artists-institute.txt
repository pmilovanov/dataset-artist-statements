The fifth season was dedicated to Haim Steinbach. We began with a talk by Johanna Burton and a conversation with Haim Steinbach; then showed a video installation by A.K. Burns; then showed sculptures by Nina Beier; then screened short videos by Trisha Baga, Phyllis Baldino, Michael Bell-Smith, Alex Hubbard, Mark Leckey, Hannah Sawtell, Stuart Sherman, and B. Wurtz; then heard Levi Bryant talk about machines; then asked people to read texts by Arjun Appadurai, Timotheus Vermeulen &amp; Robin van den Akker, and Artie Vierkant and held three meditations; then heard Ben Vidas sound performance with subwoofers; then hosted The Bigger Picture, a group exhibition curated by Haim Steinbach; and then asked 46 artists to each bring in an object in a day-long Show and Tell. Thank you.
