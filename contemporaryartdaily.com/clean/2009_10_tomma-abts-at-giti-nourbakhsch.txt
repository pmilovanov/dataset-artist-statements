„The quality of Tomma Abts´s painting () derives from the special manner in which she submits herself to the crisis in the painterly process that decides in the emergent pictorial criteria. It is quite obvious that in doing this she does not fall back on the ciphers for crisis, which Abstract Expressionism elevated to a stylistic device. Her work is anything but expressionist. It is only at a second viewing of her pictures that one sees that the form she in the end finds, was preceded by a long and crisis-ridden process of finding decisions. At the first sight they communicate an objective impression. But what gives these pictures their special character is precisely the fact that they do not openly demonstrate their emergent qualities, but slow down the process of revealing them.“
