Maccarone is pleased to announce a showing of new two-dimensional works by Paul Lee on view at 98 Morton Street. Eight panels feature faces rendered in pastel on painted wood, which were made in the dark, and coupled by strips of cinema carpets.
Paul Lee lives and works in New York. This is the artistâ€™s third exhibition with the gallery.
