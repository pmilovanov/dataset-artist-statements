Nomadic artist André Cadere was a key figure in an avant-garde generation that contested the nature of the art object and the institutional framework of the art world in the 1970s. Modern Art Oxford presents an intimate exhibition, curated by art historian and writer Lynda Morris, that brings together archive material focusing on Cadere’s appearances, walks, lectures and interviews from 1972 until his untimely death in 1978.
The actions of Cadere centered on appearances with his colourful Barres de bois rond – ‘round bars of wood’ made of brightly painted cylindrical units. This exhibition tells the story through documents, photographs and gallery invitations of these live actions, often public walks or provocative appearances at exhibition openings, that are as significant a part of the artist’s legacy as the bars themselves. Cadere’s focus on the politics of space, both social and institutional, was against the backdrop of the economic crisis of the 70s; a time that has some parallels with today.
Cadere undertook these performative interventions in cities across Europe, London and New York. He also had strong connections to Oxford. In 1974 he came to Modern Art Oxford (then MoMA Oxford) for Hanne Darboven‘s exhibition opening and returned in 1975 for the opening of Carl Andre’s Poems. During his 1976 exhibition at the ICA, London he came to Oxford again, this time for the first of eight ‘pub presentations’ organised by Lynda Morris for the Slade Association.
Beginning in Oxford’s Turf Tavern on 13 March 1976 there followed seven consecutive evenings in London pubs hosted by figures from the contemporary art world. These events will be revised in Oxford and London around this exhibition, with the first at the Turf Tavern on the 13th December.
