Temporal positioning of events with respect to the transitory present is continually changing; future events become present, 
then pass further and further into the past. 
Or, the temporal position of events become more present, then pass further into the transitory present, then pass further and further and further into the past.
Archaeology is the study of human activity through the recovery and analysis of material culture. In Ygoloeachra (‘archaeology’ backwards), contemporary domestic objects have been covered in small, sand-colored pebbles found on the banks of the Seine. This transformation, leaving only the shape and pentimento-like traces of the original objects, turns them into something like relics from the present.
Born in 1976, Lina Viste Grønli currently lives and works in Somerville, Massachusetts. Recent solo exhibitions include Euro, Saloon, Brussels and Pentimento, Christian Andersen, Copenhagen. Recent group exhibitions include Givens, AA | LA, Los Angeles and One, No One and One Hundred Thousand, Kunsthalle Wien. Lina inaugurated The Peace Clock, a permanent sculpture for Trygve Lie Plaza, Manhattan, NY in August of 2016.
