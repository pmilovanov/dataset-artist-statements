This fall the Whitney Museum of American Art will present Wade Guyton OS, the first midcareer survey of the influential New York–based artist. Opening October 4, the exhibition will feature highlights of Guyton’s career from 1999 to the present, showcasing the breadth of his work in drawing, painting, sculpture, photography, and installation. Guyton will also premiere two new paintings, one of which spans fifty feet in length and is the artist’s largest single canvas to date. The exhibition is organized by Whitney curator Scott Rothkopf, in close collaboration with the artist, and will occupy the third-floor Peter Norton Family Galleries through January 13, 2013. This is Guyton’s first prominent solo museum exhibition in the United States, and the accompanying catalogue is his first comprehensive monograph.
Comprising more than eighty works, the show will feature a dramatic, non-chronological layout in which staggered rows of parallel walls confront the viewer like the layered pages of a book or stacked windows on a computer screen, twin references to Guyton’s sources and process. Drawing on his flair for installation, this approach will recontextualize more than a decade’s worth of his art with new pieces made specifically for the Whitney’s Marcel Breuer building—a fitting venue given Guyton’s longstanding engagement with Breuer’s work. These large-scale paintings will be exhibited alongside rows of vitrines housing eighty-five of Guyton’s “printer drawings,” while a spectacular installation of more than eighteen mirrored stainless steel sculptures will span the gallery space. The exhibition’s title Wade Guyton OS employs the commonly used acronym for a computer “operating system” and links Guyton’s work to the technological tools on which he depends. The title makes the point that the artist’s body of work is more closely akin to an open-ended system than to a fixed corpus, a point underscored by the exhibition’s highly inventive design.
