Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen has launched a new exhibition format: ‘Sensory Spaces’. For the next three years high-profile, internationally active, contemporary artists will be invited to develop a work in relation to the Willem van der Vorm Gallery. American artist Oscar Tuazon kicked off this new series.
For his first solo exhibition in the Netherlands, this summer Oscar Tuazon has the entire Willem van der Vorm Gallery at his disposal. In the first of the new ‘Sensory Spaces’ exhibitions, he arranged several sculptural constructions in the space measuring almost 200m2. The artist fuses architectural and sculptural idioms, thus dislocating the viewer’s perception of the space: the classical museum experience of ‘looking’ becomes one of ‘experiencing’.
Minimal Art
Tuazon is interested in the intrinsic qualities of the materials he uses. His sculptures exist not only to be looked at; they bring about a physical experience. Some of them must be touched or even challenged. Tuazon re-examines Minimal Art through a mixed-use of industrial and natural materials, organised in geometric structures. About his working method he has said: ‘I do much of my work on-site and that usually means I don’t have a lot of time or a lot of control over exactly what materials are available. I use what’s there. I use what’s expedient, whatever I can afford. Each solution for a problem has particular properties and those properties are always interesting to me. I let them dictate the work. I like that thinking process because it incorporates considerations of time and economy. I like thinking under duress. I think that immediacy comes through when you look at the work.’
