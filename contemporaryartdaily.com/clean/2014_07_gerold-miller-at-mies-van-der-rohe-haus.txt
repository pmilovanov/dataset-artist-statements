We are pleased to present, as part of this year’s theme “Inside and Opposite”, the work of the internationally established, Berlin-based artist Gerold Miller, who was born in 1961. The exhibition can be seen from the 8th of June to the 14th of September in the listed house on the Obersee, which Mies van der Rohe designed for the printing company owner Karl Lemke in 1932.
Gerold Miller’s minimal-conceptual work is extremely reductive, both in form and colour. In his consistently radical approach to his work he has formulated a new concept, that goes beyond conventional definitions of the graphic. His objects occupy a border territory somewhere between sculpture, wall surface and space. They explore the transition between inner and outer space. The work enters into a dialogue with the architecture of the Lemke country house, where clearly defined wall surfaces define modern architectural space.
The sculptor has devised new work for the exhibition in the Mies van der Rohe House, including an installation entitled “Monoform 2“ made up of two six-metre, gold-lacquered panels for the main wall of the house. “Monoform 2” emphasizes both the two-dimensonality of the surface and the three-dimensionality of the space. It also relates to the colour and form of one of the beautiful little details of the house, the gold-bronze MR door handles.
In choosing the colours of the objects for the exhibition “Mies van der Rohe”, Gerold Miller was also prompted by the natural colours of the external space, the green of the lawn and the blue of the sky. The wall-sized glass facades allow a constant dialogue between the
inside and the outside, between culture and nature. In responding to the colours of the location, Gerold Miller’s highly glossy, lacquered, neon-coloured objects take on a nearly immaterial presence.
