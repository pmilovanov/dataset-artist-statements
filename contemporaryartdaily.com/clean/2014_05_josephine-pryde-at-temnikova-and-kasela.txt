Knickers, Berlin.
For immediate release
The new Isosceles underwear range photographed on a model and an artist on Germany’s Baltic coast – Ahlbeck, to be precise, about four hours’ drive from Berlin. What is being promoted, where? Is that even what matters? Berlin – what’s going on there? There are some photographs of Berlin in the exhibition, too. The title reads like a caption – in which case, the exhibition would be a photograph and what is depicted within it would be sheer poetry.
