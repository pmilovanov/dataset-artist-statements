On red I’ll show you Damenstiftskirche
I’m still busy with what Rachel likes.
So I’ll stay at home
and won’t show you
milk and honey.
I was taught at Städelschule
you can invite a copycat into your untidy studio
when you buy
its preferred material before
to stir it underneath.
This will probably make
its head very busy.
This allows me to tell my neighbour
again:
The driving school car is still playing:
going from A to B
using real stuff.
They are waiting at the traffic lights.
They dont like waiting
because they are already able to do it.
I go in front of them
and show them Damenstiftskirche:
This church’s ceiling was painted in colour but
after destruction
restored in black and white
because only b/w photos were available.
As they weren’t at ease
I didn’t get any Easy Jet flights for.
