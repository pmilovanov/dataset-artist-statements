Drifting between oddball comic strip and a vocational experiment performed, the ‘Uncarture Tour’ is the result of a menippean take on the art of live caricature. Unlike reasonable caricaturists ‘The Uncarturist’ attempts to attain unlikeness and as a result describes a world of inconsistent and interchangeable forms.
In order to enact the job Siegan-Smith embarked on a tour through China and Europe penning ‘uncartures’ of people along the way. Cartoons, meta-documents, and props that pertain to and digress from the tour will be presented at the gallery.
(*) Uncartures are drawings which attempt to bear little or no resemblance to the subject (usually human).
(*) Uncarture Tour: (Aberdeen-Frankfurt-Antwerp-Macau-Shenzhen-Gaungzhou-Shanghai-Quibo-Beijing-BarcelonaMadrid-Athens-Blackpool.)

“What we experience as a good likeness in a caricature, or even in a portrait. is not necessarily a replica of anything seen”
(Gombrich)
“thanks again…the picture is excellent.”making caricartures don’t look like you”? it is a novel idea. yet my friend said though at first it did seem to be unlike, gradually it got to be vivid and really resemblant. we both like the caricarture very much.”
(Shirley, From Gaungzhou)
