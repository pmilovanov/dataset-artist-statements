I have whirled with the earth at the dawning, When the sky was a vaporous flame;
I have seen the dark universe yawning Where the black planets roll without aim,
Where they roll in their horror unheeded, Without knowledge or lustre or name.
 H.P. Lovecraft, ‘Nemesis’
A very long time ago Life struck down on our planet to make things jitter and squirm for its amusement. Actually it didn’t strike down as much as it crept along. Then blind Evolution set out on a random, slithering course bumping into stuff, taking detours, modifying, trying again. Reproduction, mutation, reproduction, mutation. But Evolution, it would seem, is a negligent and indifferent force caring neither for the body reproduced nor the body reproducing, only the act of reproduction itself. It is a manic and faulty photocopier.
Fauna is pleased to present ‘Urschleim’ a group exhibition with works by David Douard (FR), Rachel Koolen (Nl), Lea Porsager (DK), Olga Balema (US/UA) and Steinar Haga Kristensen (NO). Murals by anonymous children.
