Konrad Fischer Galerie Berlin is pleased to announce the opening of an exhibition featuring new works by the British artist Alan Charlton.
Throughout the last 40 years Charlton has been faithful to the founding principles of his work. The single monochrome canvases are always painted in different shades of grey. The standard thickness of his paintings measures 4.5 cm which in turn determines the length and width of his canvases as a paintings dimensions are always divisable by the factor 4.5.
Despite following these consistant parameters as a kind of conceptual basis, Charlton has explored a wide variety of formal possibilities. In groups of works like his Slot-, Hole-, Line, Channel- or most recently his Outline-Paintings Charlton has developed different solutions to relate his paintings to specific walls and exhibition spaces. Seriallity and order are balanced by uniqueness and spontaneous invention as his works only come to life when installed in a specific space with which they interact. The seemingly quiet works develop an unexpected rhythm as the viewer explores them from different perspectives without being offered any ideal place from which to stand and look.
Chaltonâ€™s new triangle-shaped paintings will have their debut at Konrad Fischer Berlin. The exhibition will consist of 8 single canvases whose dimensions range from 99 x 99 x 99 cm to 225 x 225 x 225 cm. Each canvas is painted a different shade of grey and the size of the canvases expand in consistant intervals of 18 cm per side of each triangle.
