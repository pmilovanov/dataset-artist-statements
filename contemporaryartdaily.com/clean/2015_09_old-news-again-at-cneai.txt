Old News is a non-profit free newspaper presenting a selection of articles and images clipped from newspapers and magazines by international artists.
Old News has been organised by the Danish curator Jacob Fabricius since 2004 and Cneai will for the first time presents Old News in its entirety. The exhibition will show more than 20 free Old News newspapers, Old News Specials and Old News Vinyl with sound works by selected artists. The anniversary exhibition will also present historical and achieve material made by artists relating to Old News and media in general.
New works and new Old News newspapers for Old News (Again) at CNEAI will feature the artists: Walead Beshty, Camille Henrot, Jakob Kolding, Liz Magic Laser, Dashiell Manley, Jennifer Mills, Lee Ranaldo and Pia Rönicke.
The guidelines and duration with which the artists are clipping articles and images change slightly each year. The newspaper clippings that the artists select during 1 day or one year is reprinted in newspaper format the following year, the year in review one could say. There are no limitations to news sources, country or language; the artist can choose what she or he wants.
Jacob Fabricius says: “When I first started thinking about Old News, I thought about how news, newspapers and information influence my life. How I select my news sources and how information can be manipulated in the media. When does a story or image printed in a daily newspaper become old? When does the news story begin and where does it end? I am interested in how artists read, use and reproduce news iterms in the artistic production. It is very exciting to present this idiosyncratic collection of articles and art works at Cneai”
Recycling news articles, headlines, images and using information from the print media has been fundamental to visual art throughout the 20th century. The first artists to use newspaper as ready- mades in their paintings were the artists Georges Braque and Pablo Picasso in the 1910s, and for the last 100 years newspapers have been used as a source of inspiration – directly or indirectly – throughout countless of artists work. The expressions are many and varied from intervention, incorporation, appropriation, reproduction of news to self published newspapers. Recycling news articles, headlines, images and using information from the print media were at the core of visual art in the 20th century. The expressions are many and varied from intervention, incorporation, appropriation, reproduction of news to self published newspapers and montaged newspaper fragments.
Old News is a project about information and media.
