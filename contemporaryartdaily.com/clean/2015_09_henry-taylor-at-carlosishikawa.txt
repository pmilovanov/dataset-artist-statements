Henry Taylor’s practice is deeply informed by the sights and sounds of his surroundings but most notably by people; those who move freely between Taylor’s life and work, often only staying long enough to have their portrait painted once: “I paint everyone, or I try to. I try to capture the moment I am with someone who could be my friend, a neighbor, a celebrity, or a homeless person.”
Carlo/Ishikawa presents recent portraits by the L.A. based artist, produced during his stay at the gallery which Taylor used as a studio for a period of one month.
