TIF SIGFRIDS is pleased to announce Heads and Gates, an exhibition of new work by Becky Kolsrud.
In this new body of work, Kolsrud continues her ongoing exploration of female portraiture. Whereas in the past, her paintings have referenced catalogues, yearbooks and stock imagery, the women represented here abstract further towards new archetypes. Two series of works, each occupying the expanse of a long wall, are presented in the gallery facing one another. A line up of cut-out heads stand in contrast to eyes peering out from behind painted gates.
In the cutout silhouettes, which the artist refers to as Double Portraits, representational painting and abstract form meet to create psychological imagery. These portraits are composed of decisive gestures of female figure, form and line. Underlying the ease of their surfaces, however, the registration of corrections and adjustments instill each portrait with a slowness and create carefully formed compositions.
Hung opposite of these Double Portraits are two large paintings, each comprised of six panels, forming a wall. A repeated gate motif extends across the canvases in a grid that simulates a storefront security gate. Goofy, sexy, straitlaced and deadass, these walls actually have eyes. The many eyes emerging between the lines seem to have no setting, no space, no perspective. Once referring directly to a physical site, the gates have grown to embody the notion of simultaneously being both inside and outside of something.
Becky Kolsrud (b.1984) lives and works in Los Angeles. She received her MFA from UCLA in 2012. Her work has recently been included in group exhibitions at Foxy Production and Maccarone gallery, both in New York. Her upcoming solo exhibition at JTT Gallery (New York) will mark her third solo exhibition by the gallery, which also represents her work. Her work is in the collection of the Hammer Museum (Los Angeles) and was recently acquired by the Hall Foundation.
