ribordy contemporary is pleased to announce the first solo exhibition by Canadian born Ryan Foerster in Switzerland.
Foerster continues to explore his immediate and emotional surroundings creating an installation that reflects an abstracted train of thought. Using traditional documentary aesthetics as his starting point, Foersters photographs have transformed into near abstraction questioning ideas of time and perspective. Found objects are presented side by side with photographs of Foersters extended family building new layers of narrative. Reversed Aluminum Printing Plates 2007-10 are saved from previous zines Foerster had made and taken from the printers. On one side are the screens created from photographs to print the zines but here only the backsides are shown with the ink marks remaining from the printer creating objects that cross between photography and painting, the created and found. The shiny surface of the plates begin to act as mirrors reflecting the room, adding a melancholic atmosphere. Other photographic objects presented here for the first time were created during his time as a darkroom technician using paper to clean the print processor which were exposed to light or chemicals accidentally. When presented along with traditional photos these works act as connecting points. Also throughout the exhibition will be wood benches that Foerster learned to make this summer while visiting his grandparents.
Previous solo exhibitions include Swiss Institute NY 2008 and White Columns NY 2007.
