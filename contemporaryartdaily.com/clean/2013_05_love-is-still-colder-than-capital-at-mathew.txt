Love is colder than capital said René six years ago.
Love is colder than death said Rainer a few decades earlier.
And Kai sang in the last century: Ich möchte mich so gerne versöhnen, mit allem, was es gibt. Möchte einmal alles sein und rühre so mit am Werke.
I can feel quite well what Kai means, still to write a press release for Mathew is not possible from my position. And this in spite of all my admiration for Mathew.
Nicolas, Than, David, Nick, Clay, Megan, Vernon, Pete, and Ken, they are so wonderful that I could fall in love with each of them right away. Concerning the possibility of writing a press release for Mathew though, capital is whispering in my ears: NO.
