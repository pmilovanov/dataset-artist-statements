The exhibition Mahlzeit (meal) by Imi Knoebel shows a series of three tables, two of which consist of three elements and one of two elements. Both, the single element as well as the puzzle-like complete unit function as a table, just as needed. In their form, colour and material the tables bears signature. Outline and thickness of the table tops remind of his wall objects.applies the clear colours by hand, so his brushstroke is visible. With this concept he reverts to one of his works from 1982, a table produced on the occasion of his single show at the Stedelijk Van Abbemuseum Eindhoven in an edition of 25.
The tables are designed to be used. Their coating prevents the surface from scratches and shock damages. The series is produced in an edition of 3 + 2 a.p. in close cooperation with a carpenter.
