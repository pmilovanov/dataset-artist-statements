(Conversation between a cat and a wall at 11:25 AM =
« Oh- somebody is running after me, i saw myself all over the walls on the street. 33333333333333333.
+What ? Strange.
« The walls aren’t supporting anything, and I can walk through them !!!
There is another layer over there, made by lines and curves. It’s moving.
I can’t see them, dazzled by the absence of the sun. It hasn’t rise since ever.
Why are U building those strange architecture. Do you think the world operates this way ? No it’s not. It’s not working !!
? Are you dancing with your shadow ? This shadow – difficult to have my head in place inside of this.
Anyhow, I can’t understand how this all works, I see all the side at the same time. I have thousands eyes. And those volumes. I can’t touch them, I can’t touch anything.
? but where does thoses trees come from ? There weren’t here one minute ago… !!!
Where are U ?
Just over there, the only thing I even recognise are those graffitis.
hmm… My feet are leaving the ground, HEHE, I can’t touch the ground. I have no weight anymore, strange…
* And I’m upside down now, interesting seeing you from the top !
I see the blue forms. Everything is turning blue. And darker.
Is this a garden ? Are WE in a garden !? The leaves spakle. I’m blind !
What time is it ?
