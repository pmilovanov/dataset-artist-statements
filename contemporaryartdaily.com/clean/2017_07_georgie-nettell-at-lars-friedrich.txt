Depending on how you look at it, aggressive online discourse could be seen as a positive or negative result of media platforms that allow, or demand, regular self expression from people from all walks of life. Within the wider culture, and also specifically within the social spheres visible to me, violent opinion wars fueled by legitimate rage are hosted on corporate platforms and rival factions, with their differing priorities, compromises and blind spots, avoid perspectives they are invested in not hearing. In the end the pros and cons of increasing polarisation weigh against the advantages and disadvantages of meeting in the middle.
