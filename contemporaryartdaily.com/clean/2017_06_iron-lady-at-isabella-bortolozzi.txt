First, rose with bright bergamot highlights calls freshness to mind, but this floral can’t hide its capriciousness. Aldehydes are accompanied by fragrances of rose and jasmine. The aldehyde note is now surrounded by pelargonium and rose absolute, which somewhat softens the sharp metal note of the original composition, ending with a comfortable combination of oak moss, vetiver, musk and balsamic notes. The lily of the valley is very pleasing, the rose light and not heavy-handed: there’s a soft powderiness, but when you close your eyes you are also reminded of that iconic green creation, Vent Vert (it shares notes of muguet and rose, as well as peach, with that Balmain classic). Wet mossy notes, geranium – and a blink-and-you’ll-miss-it hit of Lapsang Souchong smokiness after it’s been spritzed. Then – just like a summer’s morning when the temperature climbs – those floral notes start to open, and warm the fragrance up. The fragrance of aldehydes is pure and fresh, and reminds one of the odor of clean linen just brought into the house form the fresh frosty air. An unexpected middle arises: oak moss, vetiver and musk quickly take over, setting up the deeply quixotic finish.
Inspired by the French avant-garde, the classic fragrance of Rive Gauche was designed by Yves Saint Laurent to show in scent the independent and unpredictable spirit of YSL Rive Gauche Prêt-à-Porter. The iconic Chanel N°5, of the Right Bank, is the quintessential symbol of haute couture, the embodiment of restraint &amp; maturity, the bottles stopper, cut like a diamond, inspired by the geometry of the Place Vendôme.
