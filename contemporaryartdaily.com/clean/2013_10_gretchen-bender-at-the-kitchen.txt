Among the most prescient yet overlooked figures of her generation, Gretchen Bender (1951-2004) anticipated our current state of image saturation, using scaffolds of screens, hypnotic repetitions of appropriated television footage, and aggressive sound as a critical match for an emerging cultural field of special effects and immersive viewing experiences. In this focused selection of Benders videos, Total Recall—her seminal video performance, originally exhibited at The Kitchen in 1987—and Wild Dead are presented alongside the artists efforts in music video and broadcast television, including her legendary title sequence for America’s Most Wanted. Curated by Philip Vanderhyden for The Poor Farm, and organized at The Kitchen by Lumi Tan and Tim Griffin.
Exhibition Hours: Tues–Fri, 12–6pm; Sat 11–6pm. Total Recall (1987) will be screened on the first floor Tuesday-Saturday every half hour from 12pm-5:30pm. On Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays, there will be an additional 6pm screening. The running time is 18 minutes. There is no late seating.
