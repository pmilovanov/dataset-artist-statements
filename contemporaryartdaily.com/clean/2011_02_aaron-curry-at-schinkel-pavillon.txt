The sculptures and paintings of Aaron Curry explore complex relationships between drawing and form, abstraction and figuration, and space, both real and virtual. The artists recent works blurred conventional distinctions between figure and ground, subverting the white cube of the gallery and creating an environment of total optical immersion. For his exhibition at Schinkel Pavillon Aaron Curry continues to re-imagine the possibilities of sculpture. Six new works all created in Berlin during the artists residency as an American Academy fellow elevate two-dimensional drawing to active, three-dimensional form. As the works lean, hang and weave amongst one another, historical references abound; yet the works continually reinvent their precedents, allowing the emergence of new possibilities for the meaning and interpretation of abstract form in space.
Aaron Curry is the 2010 Guna S. Mundheim Visual Arts Fellow at the American Academy in Berlin. His work is a major presence in the current traveling exhibition, Alexander Calder and Contemporary Art: Form, Balance, Joy, organized by the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago.
