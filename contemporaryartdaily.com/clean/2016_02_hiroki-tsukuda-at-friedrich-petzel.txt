Petzel Gallery is pleased to announce Enter the O, a solo exhibition of new works on paper, sculpture, and installation by Japanese artist Hiroki Tsukuda. This is Tsukuda’s first exhibition at Petzel Gallery and his first time exhibiting in the States.
Enter the O is derived from Tsukuda’s primary experience with the physical world. During his youth on Japan’s Shikoku Island, Tsukuda often envisioned the landscapes and possible alternate dimensions that lay beyond the Sanuki Mountains to the South and the Seto Inland Sea to the North. Later in Tokyo, these conjured terrains—which Tsukuda deems “outer worlds”—became imbued with the bold, dynamic architecture of Japan’s capital city. The artist’s ink drawings explore the turbulent, futuristic cityscapes of his imaginings. Created with meticulous detail these intricate, symmetrically fantastic works illustrate collapsed spaces, in which mechanized worlds merge with sci-fi mythos.
Two separate installations, materialized directly from the drawings that circumscribe them, recall the origin of Tsukuda’s monochromatic landscapes while augmenting the point of entry into the “O.” Unveiled in this exhibition is a new freestanding mask sculpture that investigates the artist’s own perception within his ulterior realms.
Hiroki Tsukuda was born in 1978 in Kagawa, Japan. He graduated from the Department of Imaging Arts &amp; Sciences at Musashino Art University in 2001. Hiroki Tsukuda lives and works in Tokyo, Japan.
