THIS IS OUR MUSIC marks a shift in Minamikawas practice towards indication if not representation. Where in past paintings image served as erasure, in the present body of work Minamikawa allows for the introduction of an interrogative element. Embodying this shift, the exhibition title itself calls into question both media and maker. What is this? This is our music.
