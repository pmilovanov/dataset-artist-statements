Tommaso Corvi-Mora is pleased to present Intensité Assouvissante, an exhibition of new work by French artist Dominique Gonzalez-Foerster.
The current exhibition has at its core the Apparitions, a series of works that the artist started in 2012. The series consists of a gallery of characters visualized through the use of costumes, wigs and make up. The series has included Edgar Allan Poe, Lola Montez as performed by Martine Carol in Max Ophül’s Lola Montès (1955), Bob Dylan, the character of Vicky Anderson (Faye Dunaway) in The Thomas Crown Affair (1968) and many others. A precursor to the Apparitions was De Novo (2009), shown in this gallery in 2010, a video the artist made for her participation to the 2009 Venice Biennale. In it, Dominique Gonzalez-Foerster recounts her experiences of exhibiting in Venice over the years. La Loge (Numéro Rouge) (2018) is a kind of sequel to La Loge (Numéro Bleu), first exhibited at the Musée d’Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris in 1993.
The other work in the exhibition, Textbau (2018), is displayed in the same room where De Novo was screened a few years ago. It shares some of its concerns and subject matter while also touching upon new autobiographical elements.
