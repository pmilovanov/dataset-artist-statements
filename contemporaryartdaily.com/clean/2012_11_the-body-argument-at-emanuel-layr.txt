The Body Argument
Although the works of art by Agnes Denes, Lili Reynaud-Dewar, Cl√©ment Rodzielsky, and Emily Wardill demonstrate a prevalence of objectness and movement in equal turn, they are presented together in the exhibition The Body Argument. The artists take certain parts of the human body as a point of departure for creating works through means of repetition and symmetry. The fragmented body functions as an argument for manipulation (using casting, printing, framing, distortion, etc.) that is intended to emphasize corporeality and plasticity. The body is incorporated into each object and justifies all action.
