The Cuban artist, Diango Hernández (born in 1970 in Sancti Spíritus, Cuba), studied industrial design in Havana in the 1990s and became one of the founders of a collective of Cuban artists and designers named “Ordo Amoris Cabinet”.
Diango Hernández presented his work both in individual exhibitions in the Kunsthalle Münster and in the Kunstverein Nürnberg and recently in the Museum Morsbroich in Leverkusen. He attended group exhibitions in the Kunsthalle Düsseldorf, the Kunsthalle Basel, the Kunstverein in Hamburg and the Museum Ludwig in Cologne.
Diango Hernández reveals individual moments of his biography in his paintings, objects and wall paintings. The longing for the lost home, the beach, the fruits and the language characterizes his aesthetic vocabulary. The meandering speeches of Fidel Castros transforms Diango Hernández into new visual expressions: in a wall painting, words become waves and waves to a sea of blue signs. Home as an ideological construction and home as a place of longing, the two memory axes, energy storage and the perpetual motion of the artistic production of Diango Hernández. The exhibition presents a comprehensive insight into his work with works from the past three years.
