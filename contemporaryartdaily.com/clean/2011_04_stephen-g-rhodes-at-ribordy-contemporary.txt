Stephen G. Rhodes (* 1977) invests the basement of the gallery with a new rotating channel film, Receding Mind: Circle of the Narrative of a Circle As Told by Oneself, centered on the character of Frederick Douglas, politician and writer, born black slave, who was one of most famous American abolitionists of the nineteenth century.
Four paintings on plywood, cut out from the decor background of the video are displayed. His obscure and theatrical multimedia installations explore the historical unconscious, the borrowing strategies of educational entertainment found in amusement parks, period films, or museum scenography. When Rhodes tackles a subject he tackles it head on, dismembering the various parts in order to reveal the hidden side.
