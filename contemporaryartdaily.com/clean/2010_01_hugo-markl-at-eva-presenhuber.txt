Galerie Eva Presenhuber is pleased to present, after two years, a new solo exhibition by New York-based artist Hugo Markl.
New works on paper in sublimely colored frames. Motif and title of every piece preform a conceptually ambivalent level. The 25 works, the IQs, came into being as the artist was performing a concentrated reflection on receptive processes per se – misunderstanding resulting from ignorance, and deliberate intellectual error – in relation to the processing of text, film, and art: tradition understood as intellectual auto-digestion.
Within every tradition, overcoming artistic and intellectual key works has been characterized by mixing facts with fiction.
