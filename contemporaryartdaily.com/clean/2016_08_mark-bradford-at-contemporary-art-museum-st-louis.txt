The Contemporary Art Museum St. Louis (CAM) presents the museum debut of Los Angeles-based artist Mark Bradford‚Äôs Receive Calls on Your Cell Phone From Jail. On view May 6 through August 14, 2016, on CAM‚Äôs Project Wall, the installation is a grid of  paintings comprising posters that discuss the challenges surrounding receiving collect calls from prison on one‚Äôs cell phone. Through a signature collage process, Bradford abstracts the geographic, political, and socioeconomic landscape of American cities. He composes his works by affixing found materials‚Äîsuch as billboard posters‚Äîto canvas, often searching his South Los Angeles neighborhood for signage and rooting his work in the realities of urban life. In his mixed-media compositions, paper replaces paint and is often torn, glued, sanded, and saturated with water to create a malleable pulp: materials that cling to the city are repurposed and given a renewed agency. While formally furthering the legacy of Abstract Expressionism, Bradford‚Äôs work has a unique cartographic quality that visualizes how communities are mapped or quantified. Through his use of materials, Bradford‚Äôs form of abstraction looks outward to respond to the charged social milieu in which they are made.
Many cell phone providers restrict subscribers from receiving collect calls, making this act of communication sometimes illegal and often difficult to enact, isolating incarcerated individuals and leaving them further dislocated from the outside world. The work has twice been adapted to specific sites, and at CAM the work is exhibited across a singular wall to be ‚Äúread‚Äù from left to right, embodying a melancholic passage of time. Bradford builds up and then tears down these work‚Äôs surfaces, asking viewers to consider how incarcerated people might feel consumed, abandoned, and discarded by the criminal justice system.



Part of Receive Calls on Your Cell Phone from Jail, Mark Bradfords single-channel video Practice (2003), which depicts the artist playing basketball on an outdoor court, is on view in the Front Room. Wearing a makeshift outfit that includes a Los Angeles Lakers uniform and a voluminous antebellum-style hoop skirt, Bradford is impeded by both the wind and the physical constraints of his cumbersome wardrobe. He repeatedly stumbles and falls, only to recover and continue shooting baskets. Imbued with humor, irony, and absurdity, Practice demonstrates a determination to persevere in the face of cultural, gender, and racial obstacles, both past and present.
