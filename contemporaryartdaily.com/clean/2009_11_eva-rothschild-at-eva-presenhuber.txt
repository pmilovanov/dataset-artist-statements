Galerie Eva Presenhuber is pleased to announce the opening of Eva Rothschilds second show at the gallery. Born in Dublin in 1971, Rothschild studied at University of Ulster in Belfast and Goldsmiths college. In recent years, Rothschild has earned a reputation as one of Britainâ€™s leading sculptors. She was awarded the 2009 Duveens Commission by the Tate Britain, and her large scale installation Cold Corners can be seen there until November 29th.
For her show at Galerie Eva Presenhuber, she has created a new body of works which draw on her continued interest in sculptural form and perceptual confusion. The act of making and the transformation of materials are fundamental to Rothschilds practice, and she is always interested in the expansion of her sculptural vocabulary through the introduction of new processes. For Rothschild the complications surrounding the physical presence of each piece are key, she is always keen to explore the gap between the physical manifestation and the visual perception of the work.
Central to her practice is the question of how the work will be transformed by the eye, body and consciousness of the viewer. Here, alongside her leather and wooden works, she will present new pieces made using resin, ceramics and found objects. Two large screens held together by a tangled mass of woven leather will dominate the gallery, creating a temporary centre around which the other almost domestic scale objects orbit.
