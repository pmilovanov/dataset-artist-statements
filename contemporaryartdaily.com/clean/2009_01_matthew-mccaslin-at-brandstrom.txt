Brandstrom Stockholm is pleased to announce American artist Matthew McCaslin’s first solo exhibition in Scandinavia. McCaslin has exhibited extensively in the United States and Europe in the last twenty years and is internationally acclaimed for his sculpture and installation work.
The exhibition features new installations, sculptures and videos all from this year that fuse the ephemerality of video and light with the prosaic physicality of household objects and building materials. McCaslin explores the experience of nature – the world outside of walled and wired existence – manipulated to maximize visual pleasure, but also to underscore our conflicted relationship with the natural environment, mediated as it is by technology.
Bringing the great outdoors inside, the largest work Wallflower consists of a group of wall- mounted video monitors showing colourful flowers, blooming in an endless cycle of delirious beauty. In Horizon Line videographic cows graze under black light. A hanging sculpture made from ceiling fans, Charlie don’t Surf, suggests a poignant wilting flower, and in Manipulated Meditation a perpetually setting sun becomes the object of worship in an ad hoc shrine.
Matthew McCaslin (b. 1957) lives and works in Brooklyn, New York and received a B.F.A. from Parsons School of Art. Recent exhibitions included Musee dart Moderne, St. Etienne, France (2008), Weserburg Museum fur moderne Kunst Bremen (2008), Museum fur Moderne Kunst, Frankfurt, Germany (2007), FRAC Bourgogne, Dijon, France (2007), and Le Magasin, Grenoble, France (2006).
