Shane Campbell Gallery is pleased to announce a solo exhibition of new paintings by Joanne Greenbaum.
This will be Greenbaum’s second exhibition with the gallery in Chicago. Greenbaum will exhibit a group of small-scale abstract paintings, all of which are 16 x 12 inches. This exhibition follows a recent exhibition of similar work shown at D’Amelio Terras Gallery in New York in which she showed small-scale paintings for the first time. The group of paintings reveals the range of Greenbaum’s interest in formal painterly concerns of structure, line, palette, negation, and mark-making through the constraints and intimacy of the small support.
Greenbaum’s work is currently featured on the cover of Chicago-based band, Wilco’s new album, The Whole Love. Accompanying the Deluxe CD is a 52-page booklet featuring the work of Greenbaum. Her work is also included in the recent text, Painting Abstraction: New Elements in Abstract Painting, by Bob Nickas. In 2008, Greenbaum was the subject of a solo museum survey exhibition at Haus Konstruktiv, in Zurich, Switzerland and traveled to the Museum Abteiberg, in Monchengladbach, Germany. Greenbaum has forthcoming solo exhibitions in London with greengrassi Gallery and in Switzerland with Nicolas Krupp Gallery in 2012.
