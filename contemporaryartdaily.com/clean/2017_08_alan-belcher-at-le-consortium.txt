Known for developing the «photo-object» genre (artworks which fused the disciplines of photography and sculpture), that exploration has been furthered with a multiple series of what can be seen as perhaps the ultimate «photo-object». The ephemeral nature of the universal jpeg has been addressed, and the default jpeg icon has been solidified into a standard image surrogate.
This ceramic multiple edition is entitled _____.jpg and was fabricated in China, in an edition of 125, each signed, numbered and dated.
An established visual and conceptual artist, with a foundation of solo and group exhibitions. He is recognized as a driving force behind the hybrid of photography and sculpture («photo-objects»), and is known for a directness and a sharp simplicity when approaching difficult subject matter. A sense of humour and a reverence for Pop, as well as a hands-on approach, invade much of his conceptual practice.
He was co-founder and co-director of Gallery Nature Morte (with artist Peter Nagy) in New York’s East Village from 1982–88.
Born in Toronto, he has lived in Vancouver (1976-77), New York City (1977-86), and Köln (1991-96) —has lived and worked in Toronto during all other periods of time.
