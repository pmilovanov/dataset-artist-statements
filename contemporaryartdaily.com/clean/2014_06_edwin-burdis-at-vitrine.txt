VITRINE is delighted to announce the solo exhibition of London-based artist Edwin Burdis, who has been represented by the gallery since Autumn 2013. Burdiss exhibition uses VITRINEs two spaces in Bermondsey and presents a new series of paintings, exploring themes of identity and character through the lens of the artists’ loosely woven narrative.
Burdis realises work via a diverse spectrum of production that spans painting, sound, sculpture and drawing. Increasingly, his physical work then lays down a platform for building narrative or performance, as seen in his recent series of operettas.
‘The Plumbers’ is a new series of paintings produced over the past year, in which the artist carves life-size figures from plywood then in his signature style, using household acrylic paint; he brings a spectrum of characters to life. A tribe of plumbers with names and individual characters, waiting to enter centre stage. Concomitantly each one is a self-portrait of a young man in all his contemporary guises. These works are also the first series to incorporate collage within the paint; eyes, pearl earrings and clothing embellishments.
