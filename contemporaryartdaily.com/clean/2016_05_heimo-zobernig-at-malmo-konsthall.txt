The Vienna-based artist Heimo Zobernig has achieved wide recognition for his sculptures, paintings, videos and performances.
For this solo exhibition at Malmö Konsthall, which is Zobernig’s first solo presentation in the Nordic countries, a series of new sculptures reflects on the iconic architecture of the gallery space, unpacking its role as a neutral container for art. The artist has incorporated the temporary partition walls built to display works in the preceding exhibition, Joan Jonas’s Light Time Tales, which have been left unaltered in their original positions. This enables them to gain significance as sculptures that bear an ambivalent resemblance to plinths and stage props, subtly questioning what an artwork is.
