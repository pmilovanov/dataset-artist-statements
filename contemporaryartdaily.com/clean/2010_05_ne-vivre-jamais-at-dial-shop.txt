After a decade of production, this year Dial presents a birthday to celebrate the music. The compilation 2010 points into the future, rather than being just a nostalgic retrospective, but ten years of Dial does not only stand for ten years of records it also means tangible fashioning in all sorts of forms. The attempt of converting the physical reference of this practice into a space was previously realized in the 2005 exhibition “No Competitive Offers” in Den Bosch. Now this idea is picked up again in the form of a retail shop in Berlin. For a short period of time, this specially designed Dial Shop will exhibit and offer music, record cover designs, editions, multiples and works by:
Amelie von Wulffen, Pantha du Prince, Michaela Meise, Kassian Troyer, Hanna Schwarz, Phantom Ghost, Nina Koenneman, Lawrence, David Lieske, Jakoenigja, Anna Moeller, Julian Goethe, Dominique, Michaela Eichwald, John Roberts, Manuel Räder, Rndm, Karl Orton, Pigon, Nick Mauss, Christian Naujoks, Hinda Weiss, Laid, Nairy Baghramian, Sten, Jan Timme, Arises, Momus, Heji Shin, Dirk von Lowtzow, Isolée, Annette Kelm, Roman Flügel, Diamantenraeuber, Stefan Thater, Mense Reents, Pawel, Fionn McCann, Nike Boredom, Sergej Jensen, Efdemin, Cosima von Bonin, Matthias Schaufler, Thomas Eggerer, Michael Hakimi, Josephine Pryde, Christian Doering, Claudia Riedel, Markus Selg, Birgit Megerle, Hendrik Weber, Nightshift, Nora Schultz, Christian Flamm, Dirk Stewen, John Stezaker, and Isabelle Graw.
The exhibition shop will feature all previously released Dial records and cds, many of them still in print. Additionally, there will be two new Dial products on offer. First, theres a collaboration between Michaela Meise and David Lieske, who designed an edition of 15 record boxes, each uniquely painted and lined. Secondly, the shop will offer a proposal for a dial wallpaper designed by the artist Julian Goethe, who was responsible for the design of the last Dominique album.
