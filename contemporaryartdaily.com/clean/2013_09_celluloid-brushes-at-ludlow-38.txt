MINI/Goethe-Institut Curatorial Residencies Ludlow 38 is pleased to present Celluloid Brushes: An Anthology of the Filmic Perception of the Artist from 1942 till Today, a project by Etablissement d’en Face.
“Van Gogh! Such madness! And then Cezanne! He sawed on barred windows and then all the losers broke free.”—“Who do you have in mind?”—“Who do I have in mind? Pollock. Wols. De Kooning. And all the others who break their own hands painting.”—“Well, there has to be that type, too…” Albert Oehlen as Marcel Duchamp and Theo Altenberg as Andy Warhol in Terese Schulmeister’s opulent Andy’s Cake, as well as other rarely seen films, Hollywood productions, auteur cinema classics and artists’ videos on the life and work of famous or fictitious artists will be screened at Ludlow 38 during opening hours.
Etablissement d’en Face is a working group based in Brussels, currently consisting of Michael Van den Abeele, Sven Augustijnen, Olivier Foulon, Zin Taylor, Harald Thys, Margot Vanheusden, Peter Wächtler, and Etienne Wynants. Since 1991, Etablissement d’en Face has been organizing exhibitions, screenings, and talks at its own venue in Brussels, where Celluloid Brushes was first shown in 2011. Celluloid Brushes was subsequently presented at the Witte de With in Rotterdam and at Isabella Bortolozzi Gallery in Berlin, both in 2012 . Celluloid Brushes is a growing archive and will incorporate the new posters commissioned by Ludlow 38.
