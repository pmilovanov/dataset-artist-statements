Stuart Shave/Modern Art is pleased to announce an exhibition of drawings by Tom of Finland. This show at Modern Art is comprised of some 30 figurative pencil drawings dating from the early 1960s to the late 1980s, each made as preparatory studies for the highly finished illustrations of gay visual identity for which Tom of Finland is internationally renowned. It is the first solo exhibition of the artists work held in Britain.
