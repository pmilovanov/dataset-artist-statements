Garth Weiser is best known for his highly graphic paintings that compress the vocabulary of abstraction into dense pastiches of history and technique. For his exhibition at White Flag Projects, Weiser presents three paintings of differing form, each emphasizing their discrete intentionalities and temporal relationships to their substrates and mediums. The works include Wall Painting for White Flag Projects, a temporary mural which occupies the gallerys largest wall; a second painting rendered in water-soluble media on the exterior of the gallery; and an installation of 150 pages torn from I wouldnt have worn mascara if I knew I was going to be taking a trip down memory lane, an artists book reproducing Weisers 2008 painting of the same title.
Garth Weiser has exhibited extensively, including solo shows with Casey Kaplan, New York; Altman Siegel Gallery, San Francisco; and Guild and Greyshkul, New York. His group exhibitions include The Triumph of Painting; Abstract America, Saatchi Gallery, London; Greater New York, PS1 MoMA, Long Island City, New York; Gruppenausstellung, Autocenter, Berlin; and Constellations: Paintings from the MCA Collection, Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago. His work has been discussed in The New York Times, Flash Art, The New Yorker, Frieze Online, and The Chicago Tribune. Weiser earned his MFA from Columbia University of the Arts, New York, in 2005 and his BFA from Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art, New York, in 2003.
