On view at Francesca Pia Gallery are six to eight new works by John Tremblay. Comprised of colorful abstract paintings and wooden wall pieces, the exhibition concerns the precision of mechanical process and the articulation of a hand-made geometry. Slot Effect, a teak veneered wall sculpture has five intentionally varied and randomly distanced horizontal slots. Each work has a different treatment inside its cut away edge. One is lined with reflective material, the other newsprint and the third white enamel. These vacancies in the surface reveal the wall on which the works hang; they gesture to the floor, the ceiling, the doors, the office behind them, the structural and the theoretical network in which the artwork operates. Another element of the show consists of two vertical triptychs, painted monochromes, one metallic silver (Box Set for D.J.) the other black enamel on canvas (Stacked for S.P.) over shaped stretchers. The stacked/shaped forms portray space as much as they rely on their planar flatness to deny any spatial resonance. Objects, which are combined with their shadows are eluded to or referenced in a shadow-as-object toss-up. Though, either way, this leaves us in a dynamic spot as viewers. It is on the wall that these manicured panels meet and diverge from their painterly counterparts. Undulating brush strokes approach the look of wood grain in Motherland of Electricity. Horizontal blocks of color begin at the upper left and, step by step, work their way to the bottom right hand corner. Like the voids of the wood panels these colored blocks are surrogates for image or text. It is possible for abstraction to be a diagram of itself as is proven by these works. The objects describe themselves best, much better than I can. When this happens it is moving.
