The German artist Jutta Koether(b. 1957) lives and works in New York and, more recently, in Berlin. She is a professor at the Hochschule für Bildende Künste in Hamburg.
Her work, with its multifaceted art practice has never been shown in Sweden. The exhibition at Moderna Museet will feature some 30 works from 2005 to the present day. For many years, Jutta Koether has been an artists’ artist, producing works that mix painting, performance and music. She is also an art critic and contributor to the music magazine Spex. Works by Jutta Koether have been shown at venues including the Whitney Biennial in New York and the Kölnischer Kunstverein and Kunsthalle Bern.
For the Moderna Museet exhibition a performance programme is planned, featuring Jutta Koether herself, the legendary Kim Gordon (Sonic Youth guitarist) and the poet Tony Conrad. A selection of her previous performances will be shown in conjunction with the exhibition.
