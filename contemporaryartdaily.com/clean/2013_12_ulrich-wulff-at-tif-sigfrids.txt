TIF SIGFRIDS is pleased to present an exhibition of new works by Ulrich Wulff. Wulff’s Artistic Training Facility, Chambless, CA – the artist’s first solo exhibition in the United States – will be on view from November 16 to December 22.
In the summer of 2013, Wulff arrived in America from his native Germany, intent on realizing a series of large-format oil paintings at a remote desert studio in Chambless, California – a ghost town of less than 10 residents along a strip of the well known, but seldom traveled Route 66 highway. Working in an abandoned gas station, Wulff completed a number of watercolor studies in Chambless before retreating to a more conventional painter’s studio in Los Angeles after encountering numerous conflicts with his materials due to arid, high desert winds. Although finally completed “off-site” from the artist’s rural “training facility,” the oil-based works that eventuated in LA were nonetheless informed by Wulff’s hermetic sojourn to Chambless, where he cultivated an interest in exploring the quintessence of “desert” qualities like passivity, silence, recalcitrance, egolessness, vacuity, tranquility, and even boredom.
Wulff’s Artistic Training Facility, Chambless, CA comprises the work of this recent Chambless/LA residency, and features Wulff’s grandest painting to date in terms of scale. Executed in what Wulff calls a “poetic” mode, the images display an uncomplicated concentration on line, color, clinamen, and contrast, and stand as evocative paeans to a “deserted” or reduced mental scape; what might be called the special Chambless state of mind. Viewers are invited to dwell in and draw their own conclusions about this lyrical series that sings to simplicity, expanse, and the romantic indeterminacy of the empty American West.
