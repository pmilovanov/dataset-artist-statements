Balice Hertling &amp; Lewis is pleased to present the first solo exhibition by the American artist Charles Mayton.
The Difficult Crossing is Mayton’s translation of Magritte’s 1928 painting with the same title.
Mayton chose the Magritte in large part because it is a painting of an interior space—an ambiguous interior which mimics a studio, a domestic interior, theater, or even gallery. It dramatizes the space in which the performance of painting occurs, and suggests a model for the development of a structural poetics.
Of particular consequence in this act of translation—a painting of an interior as the inspiration for an interior with paintings—is the painting-within-a-painting on the back wall, of two ships crossing storm-tossed seas at night. These rough seas are emblematic of numerous difficult crossings.
The sea floods into the gallery but, in doing so, is transformed into the organic unhinged activity of the three-word-phrase.
The paintings are also imagined along a three-part axis, beginning with the first difficult crossing and based on a schema of Concept—Narrative—Process.
