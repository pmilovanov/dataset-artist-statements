… forsakes its existence and gives its shape over to recollection.
Liudvikas Buklys, Stano Filko, Michele Di Menna
curated by Severin Dünser and Christian Kobald
The contribution investigates the relationship between object, biography, narrative and display through fragments of works by two Eastern European artists from different countries and generations: young Lithuanian artist Liudvikas Buklys (*1984) and Slovakian documenta participant Stano Filko (*1937), complemented by a third, performative contribution by Canadian artist Michele Di Menna (*1980).The storyboard: biography, anecdote, treasure hunt, classicism, Siberia, the repository, colour, the gesamtkunstwerk, the house, id, cognition, pause, sekt, precarious. The set: three boards, white, rockets, the tasche, a statement, a catalogue, an LP, animation, two objects, a story, a performance, that which remains.
