On Thursday, the 29th of January, Gi√≥ Marconi will be pleased to present Wade Guytons solo exhibition at the gallery groundfloor.
Wade Guyton presents a new major series of works the artist casually describes as stripes. The works are produced by printing the same digital file at least twice on each piece of folded linen. The black stripes are drawn in Photoshop. They appear to be an enlarged detail of one of his black monochromes in which half of the heads are clogged producing wide black and white stripes or gaps. And they resemble a striped bathing suit worn by a model used in his Portikus poster- a found image.
The process is similar to his previous works. The Epson 9600 Ultrachrome printer he uses has a media capacity of 44 inches. The artist folds the pre-primed linen and alternates printing on front/ back, left/right. Each piece transcribes a visual record of the printers actions: the trace of movement of the print heads, the varying states of their clogged-ness, the track marks of the wheels on wet ink are all mixed with the scratches and smears on the paintings from being dragged across the floor to be fed back again into the printer.
The artist also will present new more colorful works in the other galleries.
