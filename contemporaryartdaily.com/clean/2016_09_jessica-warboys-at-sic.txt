British artist Jessica Warboys recent production Hoop Eye Dance Trance, filmed in Kiasma Theatre in Spring 2016, combines dance, painting and sound to create a sketch of movement to music. The figure animates time and space, as the body cycles through a succession of eclectic gestures rooted in their dance training, anchoring them in the present to a rhythmic and fragmented soundtrack. Filmed moving between the ground and above, the viewer experiences the performance as the dancer might imagine it.
The composition to which artist Sanni Priha moves is composed and performed by Morten Norbye Halvorsen.
The exhibition is produced in collaboration with Kiasma Theatres URB 16 Festival.
