The exhibition emphasizes the living dimension of Huyghe’s propositions, which envision the space as a world, evolving according to its own rhythms. Rather than displaying a selection of objects, the exhibition explores the porosities and the intensities that arise between elements.
The encounters that occur in Pierre Huyghe are not choreographed but unplanned; in what he refers to as an “auto-generative system,” the artist constructs a set of conditions and allows events to unfold following their own course. Exemplifying Huyghe’s unique methodology, multiple elements from his 2012 installation at dOCUMENTA (13) will have their U.S. debut in this exhibition, including Human, a white Ibizan hound, and the film A Way in Untilled, which was filmed on site in Kassel, Germany. In addition, the exhibition will include the world premiere of a new aquarium and the U.S. premiere of the film Untitled (Human Mask).
