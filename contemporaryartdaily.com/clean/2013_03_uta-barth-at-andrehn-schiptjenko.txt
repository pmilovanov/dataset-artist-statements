In keeping with her signature operating methods, Uta Barth takes a simple observation — the tenuous light filtering through a curtain — and turns it into a complex perceptual experience. The artist modifies everyday domestic spaces in ways that are nearly imperceptible, transforming them with her camera into fertile ground for exploring subtle changes of light and atmosphere. While photography generally seeks a fixed subject matter, Barth focuses her attention elsewhere:
The body of work …and to draw a bright white line with light was initially conceived for her solo exhibition at the Art Institute of Chicago in 2011. This sequence of photographs, presented in Barth’s signature diptychs and triptychs, traces a wavering band of light as its slowly winds its way across the curtains of the artist’s home over one single afternoon. Taken together, the images of such an ordinary observation are transmuted into a lyrical study of the passage of time, intensifying our sensitivity to subtle changes and our awareness of the very act of seeing.
