You cant build clouds. And thats why the future you dream of never comes.
With his project for the Temporäre Kunsthalle Berlins outer façade, Austrian artist Gerwald Rockenschaub counters this Ludwig Wittgenstein quote. The two abstract white clouds on a bright blue background are pixelated, cubic formations that refer to the designs digital origin and remind us, in their universal legibility, of computer icons. At the historically and politically charged Schlossplatz, and in an urban space flooded with information, this theme is an individual and poetic projection of all kinds of conceivable images. It deliberately references the Kunsthalle projects temporal nature and the principle of transience as the foundation for creating something new.
In his works, Gerwald Rockenschaub (*1952, Linz) mixes conceptual and cognitive-psychological approaches. His paintings, objects, installations and works on video, generated by computer, find an abstract form in their clear and functional structure.
