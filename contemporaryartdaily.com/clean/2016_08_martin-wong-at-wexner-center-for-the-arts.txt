May 14–August 7, the Wexner Center for the Arts will present Martin Wong: Human Instamatic, a comprehensive survey collecting more than 80 paintings from every stage of his career—formally inventive canvases that are in turn lyrical, gritty, and lovingly observant of the world as he found it. The Wexner Center is the first stop on a national tour for this widely acclaimed exhibition.
Human Instamatic takes its name after a term Wong coined to describe his skill at painting street portraits. This survey also includes fascinating, rarely seen archival materials, many of them from the Martin Wong Papers at Fales Library, New York University. Incorporating elements from classic Chinese art and homages to 20th-century American urban painting, whose traditions his own work was extending, Wong’s dazzling achievement is forcefully honored by this exhibition, which Hyperallergic called “one of the best museum shows to open last year.”


Martin Wong: Human Instamatic is organized by the Bronx Museum of the Arts, and curated by Antonio Sergio Bessa, director of curatorial and education programs, and Yasmin Ramírez, adjunct curator.
