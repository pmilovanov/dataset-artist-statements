Ive pushed my last
a weighty loutish little helper
merely mannered but a bit much
starving web wrap up prey
past alleyways
of bleach, cashiers, cheese
a grinning wagon
with a howling grill in rumbling pace
lift to lug, pound the trollop
up with heavy load
fetch to freight, gawk at hungry broad
and all the ferrum she just ate

I.E
