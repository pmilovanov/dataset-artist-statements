Named after a town in New Jersey where an apparition of the Virgin Mary was said to have appeared on the window of a two-story house, Rachel Harrisonâ€™s room-sized work Perth Amboy exemplifies a cross-disciplinary approach to making art. The work comprises 21 photographs, individual sculptural assemblages, and an open-ended labyrinth made from cardboard. It takes as its subject the basic acts of looking and seeing, which are central to any experience of visual art. This is the first presentation of Perth Amboy at MoMA since the work entered the collection in 2011.

Organized by Paulina Pobocha, Assistant Curator, Department of Painting and Sculpture.
