With Maja Vukoje (*1969 Dusseldorf, lives in Vienna), the Künstlerhaus is presenting one of Austria’s most essential artists, who occupies an outstanding position in the field of painting. Her solo exhibition provides an overview of her production during the past five years, as her work has increasingly manifested a genuine painterly vocabulary. The artist has created about a dozen new paintings for the show, which will be on display with selected existing pieces in the upper atrium galleries of the Künstlerhaus. To accompany this extensive exhibition, the Künstlerhaus will devote a new publication to Vukoje.
Vukoje’s paintings are based on her exploration of political themes such as post-colonialism, gender, and pop culture. Vukoje’s approach is founded on more than just her own migrant experience—she also travels to specific places in order to examine certain cultural phenomena. She then takes the resulting mixture of realities and translates them into a complex, yet easily accessible visual language.
For her latest works, she’s chosen a rather analytical approach toward the process of questioning representation. With its subject of the “Vogelscheuche” (Paul Klee, 1935; “scarecrow), the exhibition’s title metaphorically alludes to traditional genre depictions of bodies and the objects surrounding them, while the artist—in these politically confusing times—presents for debate their internal states, materials, and the forces that drive and fuel them. Vukoje’s solo show provides an overview of what she’s produced in the past five years, which increasingly allows us to recognize a genuine, painterly language.
Maja Vukoje studied painting at the University for Applied Arts in Vienna (Maria Lassnig and Christian Ludwig Attersee). She has been awardes many prizes for her work: outstanding artist award, BKA Vienna (2015), Österreichischer Grafikwettbewerb, Preis des Landes Burgenland (2005), Georg-Eisler-Preis der Bank Austria Creditanstalt, Vienna (2004), Award for young European painting, Premio del Golfo, La Spezia (2000)
