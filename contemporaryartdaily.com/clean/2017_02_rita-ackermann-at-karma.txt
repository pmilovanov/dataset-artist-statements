Karma is pleased to announce an exhibition of new works by New York-based painter Rita Ackermann.
The exhibition consists of two different bodies of work. Nudes are small oil paintings on cardboard inspired by a stash of amateur photographs which was found in the garbage and given to me for Christmas by a good friend three years ago. Dust Jacket is a monotype drawing from a series which is made of large graphite monotype originals on pigmented
prints on hot press paper.
â€” Rita Ackermann
