1301PE is pleased to present its sixth solo exhibition with Los Angeles based artist Kirsten Everberg. Everbergʼs latest body of work takes the working and living space of film director and writer Ingmar Bergman on the remote island of Fårö, Sweden, as a point of departure to explore the ways in which creative spaces are constructed and operate as sites of production. The new paintings presented at 1301PE continue Everbergʼs interest in the history and practice of filmmaking, thereby exploring the interplay between memory, fragmentation, photography, cinema and the subjective nature of perception.
“Everbergʼs subjects are less the actual buildings or locales and more the ways in which these cultural landmarks, icons, or markers have entered the public imagination” – Gloria H. Sutton
Looking both inward and outward at once, Everbergʼs interior and landscape paintings explore how Bergmanʼs studio and domestic space informed his filmmaking and how the films themselves informed his work and life. Using framing devices and fragments from cinematic moments, Everbergs collage-like compositions oscillate between the photographic, the cinematic and the painterly. Whilst from far away presenting themselves as constructed images of interiors and landscapes, the paintings upon closer consideration seductively dissolve into glossy fields of oil and enamel paint. Image and narrative; truth and fiction; abstraction and figuration – all intermingle in Everbergʼs audacious paintings.
Kirsten Everberg lives and works in Los Angeles. She has had recent solo exhibitions at the Pomona College Museum of Art, CA, Le Consortium, Dijon, France; and the Scottsdale Museum of Contemporary Art, AZ. She has been included in exhibitions at several international institutions including FRAC Champagne-Ardenne, Reims, France; Vancouver Art Gallery, Vancouver BC, Canada; Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, CA; Hammer Museum, Los Angeles, CA; and Musée des beaux-arts, Nancy, France.
