Sutton Lane is pleased to present the first solo exhibition in Paris of New York based artist Eileen Quinlan.
Mastering commercial photographys processes and equipment, Quinlan firstly arranges table-top still lifes using a very limited number of objects. Mirrors, reflecting surfaces, fabrics materiality is then emphasised to the point to suggest immateriality. Six of the new photographs on show represent a further development of the series Fahrenheit that Sutton Lane presented earlier this year in the section Statements at Art|39|Basel. The two new black and white silver gelatin prints, where the composition complexity has been pushed much further, correspond to a new engagement of the artist with big size images. Within the exhibition, Stone Roses, the sole representational image, functions as an introduction to the artists practice and as a visual explanation of her artistic concerns. In fact, within this realistic photograph are the same elements that characterise the artists semi abstract, quasi pictorial photographic outcomes. The only difference consisting in the fact that in the latter â€˜Color, atmosphere, time, composition, description are reduced to their most basic forms, and take their turn as the subject of the photographs..
Eileen Quinlan lives and works in New York. She graduated with an MFA from Columbia University, New York in 2005. She currently has a solo exhibition at Galerie Daniel Buchholz, Cologne. The artist has recently participated in Art|39|Basel Statements with Sutton Lane. Upcoming exhibitions include a solo exhibition at the ICA, Boston in 2009 and the group show Slow Movement oder: Das Halbe und das Ganze at Kunsthalle Bern, Switzerland.
Quinlans works form part of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art collection, of the collection of The Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles, of The Metropolitan Museum of Art collection in New York and the Seattle Art Museum collection.
