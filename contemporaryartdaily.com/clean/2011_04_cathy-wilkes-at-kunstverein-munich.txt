With this exhibition Kunstverein München presents the first comprehensive show outside the UK of British artist and Turner Prize nominee Cathy Wilkes (*1966 in Belfast).
The exhibition can be seen as a personal account in which the artist looks back on her oeuvre while adding two newly commissioned works to the selection. The sculptures of Cathy Wilkes are known to have an unusual fragility, by means of the appropriated artefacts and materials she incorporates within them, such as the breakfast plates of porridge she saves of her family. These elements are more comparable to personal sketches that are both anecdotal details and historic.
The solo show of Cathy Wilkes at Kunstverein München e.V. will feature new works that are produced in collaboration with GAK Gesellschaft für Aktuelle in Bremen. The exhibition will be on show in Bremen from November this year.
