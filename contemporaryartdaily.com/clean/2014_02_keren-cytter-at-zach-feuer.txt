In Gallery 2, Zach Feuer Gallery will present HOME by Keren Cytter. The exhibition consists of 65 drawings drawn from the artistâ€™s close environs and organized chronologically. Works on paper featuring text copied from newspaper headlines are shown next to simple doodles of friends or a detailed drawing of a fish that together create a bizarre mise-en-scene inspired by reality but open to individual interpretation.
