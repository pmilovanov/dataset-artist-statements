The Novel That Writes Itself is a group exhibition that celebrates Allen Ruppersberg. As an artist who has been in considerable dialogue with his peers throughout his career—often citing them in his own works— Allen has also been highly influential to a younger generation of artists working today. This exhibition, largely focusing on artists in the gallerys program, is organized in Allen’s spirit—ever interested in an expanding network of artists, ideas, and media, and in carving out opportunities for artistic exchange and dialogue. This exhibition, located in the gallery’s 8th floor space, coincides with Allen Ruppersberg’s solo exhibition on the ground floor.
