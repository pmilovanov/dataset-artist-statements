Paula Cooper Gallery is pleased to present Zoe Leonard, Kayode Ojo opening March 17 at 529 West 21st Street. This is the fourth in a series of two-person presentations at Paula Cooper Gallery’s 529 West 21st Street space curated by Laura Hunt, the gallery’s archivist.
Both Zoe Leonard and Kayode Ojo have regarded the camera as a surrogate for the artist’s body, enacting, examining, and resisting desire. With the medium of photography both artists explore what society designates as private versus public, as well as why these designations persist or dissolve.
Since the late 1980s, Zoe Leonard has investigated with sensitivity and acuity how point of view drives visibility. On view by the artist is Wax Anatomical Model with Pearls, a photograph made in 1990. Taken at The Josephinum, a medical museum in Vienna, Austria, the black and white photo documents an eighteenth century anatomically female wax model laid out in a vitrine in a “semi-erotic” pose, wearing a pearl necklace and blonde wig, with internal organs exposed.
Kayode Ojo will show photographs taken in 2017 at after-parties for New York City gallery and museum exhibition openings alongside photos of the Ojo family in Cookeville, Tennessee, the artist’s birthplace. The after-party has become a subject for Ojo due to its prevalence, proximity, and ostensible production of release and freedom. In some cases, the events’ failure to reach this freedom becomes the content of the works. Ojo’s images of peer artists dancing, talking, and performing for each other are not institutional critique, but rather observations of the satellite social events cultural institutions yield. This exhibit marks the first time that Ojo, who has exhibited primarily sculpture and installations, will show his photographs in a gallery context.
