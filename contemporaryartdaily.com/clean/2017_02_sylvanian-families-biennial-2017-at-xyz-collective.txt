XYZ Collective is pleased to announce “Sylvanian Families Biennial 2017,” a group exhibition with twelve artists and one artist collective, which will open on Sunday January 22. The exhibition will continue through Sunday February 19.
After seeing an exhibition in general, we sometime imagine “what if there was a Picassoʼs sculpture,” or “what happens if the remains of Kishio Sugaʼs performance was installed next to that video work.” We expand our imagination but it is not easy to
actualize because of various reasons such as time, budget, and relationship.
Syvanian Families is a series of dollhouse and miniature toys that was first released in 1985. The series is based on the concept of American country decor and different type of items have been released since then.
Each artist and artist collective use a Sylvanian Families dollhouse to make their imaginary exhibition plans realized. Thirteen miniature galleries will be opened at XYZ Collective and the exhibition will be held as “Sylvanian Families Biennial 2017.”
