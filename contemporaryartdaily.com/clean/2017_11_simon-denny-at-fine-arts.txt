Fine Arts, Sydney is presenting a new exhibition of work by Simon Denny, ‘Shenzhen Entrepreneurial Form’.
The exhibition comprises freestanding sculptures, works for the wall, and a video.
Simon Denny’s recent work has addressed the mainstream cultural influence of tech-related business practices.
This exhibition focuses on the Chinese city of Shenzhen as a context that foregrounds relationships between technological innovation, labour and society. Specifically, this body of work considers the confluence of Chinese governmental policy encouraging widespread entrepreneurship as an answer to questions of social security, DIY tech hardware “Maker” culture, the unique properties of Shenzhen as an electronics manufacturing hub, and the site of China’s first steps into global capitalism.
Some works here were shown in Shenzhen earlier this year in Simon Denny’s solo exhibition ‘Real Mass Entrepreneurship’ curated by Venus Lau at OCAT, and others were made for this exhibition in Sydney.
Simon Denny lives and works in Berlin. He was born in Auckland in 1982, and represented New Zealand at the 56th Venice Biennale (2015). His work was included in Manifesta 11 (2016), 9th Berlin Biennale (2016), 6th Moscow Biennale (2015), 13th Biennale de Lyon (2015), La Biennale de Montreal (2014), the 55th Venice Biennale (2013), 1st Brussels Biennial (2008), and the 16th Biennale of Sydney (2008).
