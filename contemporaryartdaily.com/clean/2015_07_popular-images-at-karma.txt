Photography is largely unclassifiable, it exists only as a means of presentation. While formal applications of photography have changed, it’s concepts, processes and ideas are abundant in the work of contemporary artists.
Popular Images brings together work by eleven American artists, not confined to any particular medium. Instead, the exhibition makes use of photography’s most prominent quality—recognizable images. Mining the media culture of movies, television, popular music and the Internet, these artists’ relationship to the material is a schizophrenic one—they are at once consumers and critics—questioning the social constructions of gender, sexuality, communication, authenticity and authorship.
