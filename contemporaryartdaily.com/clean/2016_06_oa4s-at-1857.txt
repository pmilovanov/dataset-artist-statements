The beekeeper and the fencer stand opposite one another in a long hall.
(Imagine that.)
&nbsp;
Back-to-back, and facing each other at either end.
(Somehow seeing, and at the same time not seeing, one another.)
&nbsp;
Each one stands with a mirror to their back.
(Each can see in the others mirror what the other cannot see.)
&nbsp;
Rather than a bridge, a bricolage between them.
(The distance is mended by an assemblage of gestures and forms.)
&nbsp;
They see of one another only what they may through a curling smoke of incompatibility.
(The smoke is a grey space between them, which curls and furls, limiting and permitting their visibility for one another in different formations over time.)
&nbsp;
When the fire burns the cotton, it interacts only with those qualities it needs to combust the cotton.
(Only those qualities necessary for eliciting a response are called on by the other.)
&nbsp;
The smoke says: Persistent identification of an object over time is a consequence of cognition, not of the object itself.
(As the qualities of an object are in flux over time, the appearance of a consistent identity is at most an illusion had by the perceiver.)
&nbsp;
For the beekeeper, it is the first day of a new calendar year. For the fencer, it is New Years Eve.
(They are at two terminals in a circle of time.)
&nbsp;
The grain of the fabric of their suits is thick – so much so that they feel like there are folds within the folds of their clothes.
