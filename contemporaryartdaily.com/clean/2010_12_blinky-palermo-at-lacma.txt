While Blinky Palermo’s reputation as one of the foremost post-war abstract painters is well established in Europe, his work is rarely seen in North America. Beginning its yearlong tour at LACMA, this is the first comprehensive retrospective of the work of this German artist in the United States.
The exhibition provides an in-depth examination of the evolution of Palermo’s aesthetic, illustrating the significance of his contribution to post-war art. It surveys the four principal groups of work, created after he graduated from Joseph Beuys’s class at the Dusseldorf Art Academy in 1964, that comprise his oeuvre: the Objects; Cloth Pictures; documentation of in situ Wall Paintings and Drawings; and examples of his late Metal Pictures.
Blinky Palermo: Retrospective 1964–1977 has been curated by Lynne Cooke. Organized by Dia Art Foundation and the Center for Curatorial Studies at Bard College, it will be accompanied by a full-color publication, co-published by Dia and Yale University Press.
The national tour of Blinky Palermo: Retrospective 1964–1977 is made possible by Gucci. Additional tour support is provided by The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, the Brown Foundation, the National Endowment for the Arts, and Glenstone. The Los Angeles County Museum of Art presentation is sponsored by Christie’s.
