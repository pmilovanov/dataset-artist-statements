1301PE is pleased to present its third solo exhibition of the groundbreaking artist Jack Goldstein. A central figure of the “Pictures Generation” with Cindy Sherman, Robert Longo, David Salle, Sherri Levine, Troy Brauntuch, and others, Goldstein’s work included film, performance, writing, text, painting, sound, and sculpture. The exhibition will focus on two seminal works: Burning Window and Aphorisms.
From 1976 until 1984, Goldstein made a number of singular works that focused on spectacle and the cinematic. Burning Window (1977) is the most iconic installation. In it Goldstein created a relationship between the viewer and the object that is defined by distance rather than immersion.
This spectacle, which may be felt ambiguously both “real” and as a “cinematic” illusion, calls into question the “truth” of visual experience. – Jack Goldstein
Writing was always a part of Goldstein’s practice. In 1982 Goldstein participated in documenta 7, he included a series of writings on his artist page in the catalogue. He called them Aphorisms, considering them visual language. They would appear in his 1985 exhibition at Städtische Galerie Erlangen. This time text was set in black Helvetica with specific words in each line in red. The Aphorisms became works that shifted from book to wall and back again, the same way Goldstein wanted to turn thought into something tangible and then back to a thought.
