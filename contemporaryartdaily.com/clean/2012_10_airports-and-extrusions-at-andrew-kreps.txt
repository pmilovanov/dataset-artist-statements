Airports, a photographic series by Fischli and Weiss examines the quotidian aspects of global travel by focusing the uniformity of the terminals and tarmacs in such disparate locales as Zurich and Rio de Janeiro, symptoms of the postmodern experience. The mundane subjects in these images are familiar to us all, fuel vehicles, baggage trucks, and the daily routine of the airport worker yet these photos highlight the extreme complexities of such tableaus and everyday life. Deceptively complex these photos share the same conceptual focus as their other sculptural and photographic works – the exceptional in the quotidian experience.
Airports present seemingly conventional views of the heavy, inert metallic bodies of airplanes, of the machinery on the ground. But mostly we see the space around them, the vastness and emptiness of the runway, which becomes the essence of the forms themselves. And similarly, Frank Benson’s Extrusions speak to something beyond the forms themselves – the action of their making and the space in which they occupy the fine line between repose and animation.
