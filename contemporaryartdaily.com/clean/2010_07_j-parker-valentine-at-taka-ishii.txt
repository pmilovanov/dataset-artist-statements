J. Parker Valentine is a post-conceptual draftsperson. While crafting artwork in a variety of media, Parker’s practice amounts to an elemental yet informed engagement with the act of mark-making. Endowed with a literal weight, in part a consequence of her often chosen carrier MDF panel and, contrastingly, informed by the act of erasure, Parker’s works embody site specificity; their internal drama, without resorting to the expressive, is nonetheless remarkably representative of a space in which something the act of drawing happens. Hyper-specific, the work presents a stubbornly finite presence, decidedly foreign in relation to common contemporary practice dependent, for any trace of the sensual, upon recourse to an implied infinite regress. Work on view in the Kyoto exhibition will be completed during a one month residency on Parkers first visit to Japan.
