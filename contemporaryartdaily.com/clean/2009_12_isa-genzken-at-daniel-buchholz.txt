Galerie Daniel Buchholz is proud to announce an exhibition with new works by Isa Genzken. Under the title “Wind” Isa Genzken will show an installation with a group of new sculptures as well as wall objects. Having started to work with Isa Genzken in 1987 the gallery is happy to present the ninth solo exhibition of the artist in the gallery and the first exhibition in the Berlin space.
The work of Isa Genzken has recently been shown in a survey exhibition at the Whitechapel Gallery, London and Museum Ludwig, Cologne. In 2007 Isa Genzken was invited by Nicolaus Schafhausen for a solo installation of her work in the German Pavilion at the 52nd Venice Biennale.
The exhibition “Wind” is accompanied by an exhibition of new wall objects under the same title at Neugerriemschneider, Berlin and coincides with the reconstruction of the historic Installation “3 Vollellipsoide Skulpturen” of the artist from 1978 at the Museum für Moderne Kunst MMK in Frankfurt a.M.
“In her most recent work, Genzken confronts one of the prime calamities of sculpture in the present: a terror that emerges from both the universal equivalence and exchangeability of all objects and materials and the simultaneous impossibility of imbuing any transgressive definition of sculpture with priorities or criteria of selection, of choice, let alone judgment (be it artisanal skills, choice of objects or materials, or the analytical intelligence to identify the specific structure of a contextualized readymade). To have the self succumb to the totalitarian order of objects brings the sculptor to the brink of psychosis, and Genzken’s new work seems to inhabit that position. However, since total submission to the terror of consumption is indeed the governing stratum of collective object relations, that psychotic state may well become the only position and practice the sculptor of the future can articulate.”*
