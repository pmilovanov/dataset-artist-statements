SculptureCenter is pleased to announce Michael E. Smith’s first major solo museum exhibition in the United States. The exhibition, on view May 3–August 3, 2015, will present new works created specifically for SculptureCenter’s lower level galleries. These new sculptures and videos further Smith’s investigation into the complex existence of things.
Many of the objects in Smith’s sculptures are decelerated and slackened until they reach a trancelike state. Sometimes frozen, and sometimes literally or figuratively spurned into action, though actual movement or in association to other objects or images, the primary function of the everyday things we encounter in his work is interrupted and reconfigured. These periodic suspensions of movement and time only serve as reminders of the inherent rhythms of things and bodies. To articulate this further, Smith has created new video works in addition to the sculptures that will be on view. Highlighting the physiological qualities of machines, they isolate and intensify a range of internal mechanisms.
The works on view respond to the subterranean architecture of the lower level exhibition galleries, abstractly examining notions of history and functionality. Smith’s installation shifts the given conditions and atmospheres at SculptureCenter, presenting a space that reassess relationships maintained within our inner and outer worlds.
