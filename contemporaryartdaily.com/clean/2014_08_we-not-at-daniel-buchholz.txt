We are pleased to announce an exhibition of collaborative works by Cosima von Bonin, Michael Krebber and Sergej Jensen at our gallerys two addresses in Cologne. We can only make assumptions and leave it up to the viewer to decide if the title We not, chosen by the artists for their exhibition, relates to a notion that one cannot merge into a community, that three cannot become one.
