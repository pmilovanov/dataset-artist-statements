Anicka Yi makes artworks that confront today’s world, challenging the traditions of sculpture through unconventional materials and instability. Her work interacts with the viewer across a range of senses—such as smell—and pushes upon prevailing notions of gender roles, soft power, transparency, and posthumanism.
In 2013 Yi began a trilogy of exhibitions to explore, as she has written, “the forensics of loss and longing,” creating work inspired by the very human emotions we attach to romance and daily life: Denial, Divorce, and now, Death. Following gallery shows in Berlin and New York, the Transformer Station will host the culmination of Yi’s trilogy, which will analyze the acceptance of what it means to be human. Presenting artworks from earlier in her career as well as new pieces making their debut in Cleveland, Anicka Yi: Death will include a unique installation design that will evoke both the sterility associated with death and the flurry of life before the final breath.
