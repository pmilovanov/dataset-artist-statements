The group exhibition per form makes thematic the borders and cross-overs between action and form. It draws attention to the performative aspects of abstract and formal works and also highlights action that becomes pure form in filmic works. The exhibited artworks are concerned with the artistic means that can represent or formalise a performative moment. Not seeking to illustrate commonalities among the works, the participating artists utilise very different working methods and moreover have different artistic goals, the topic of per form is to provoke a mental impulse/impetus and furthermore provide a platform to display the various models of a synthesis of the formal and performative moments in art.
