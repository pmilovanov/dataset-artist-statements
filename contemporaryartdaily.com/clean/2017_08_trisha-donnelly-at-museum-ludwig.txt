The Ge­sellschaft für Mod­erne Kunst am Mu­se­um Lud­wig will pre­sent the 2017 Wolf­gang Hahn Prize to Tr­isha Don­nel­ly. With this prize, which has been award­ed an­nu­al­ly over the past twen­ty-three years, the or­gani­za­tion will rec­og­nize the ex­traor­d­i­nary oeu­vre of this artist, who was born in 1974 in San Fran­cis­co and now lives in New York.
The prize in­cludes the ac­qui­si­tion of a work or a group of works by the artist for the col­lec­tion of the Mu­se­um Lud­wig. An ex­hi­bi­tion of Tr­isha Don­nel­ly’s work will al­so take place at the mu­se­um, and a ca­t­a­logue will be pub­lished to com­me­m­o­rate the award. The ju­ry for the 2017 Wolf­gang Hahn Prize in­clud­ed this year’s guest ju­ror Suzanne Cot­ter, di­rec­tor of the Ser­ralves Mu­se­um of con­tem­po­rary art in Por­to; Yil­maz Dziewior, di­rec­tor of the Mu­se­um Lud­wig; Mayen Beck­mann, chair­wo­m­an of the Ge­sellschaft für Mod­erne Kunst; as well as Gabriele Bier­baum, Sabine Du­Mont Schütte, Jörg En­gels, and Robert Müller-Grünow as board mem­bers of the Ge­sellschaft für Mod­erne Kunst.
Mayen Beck­mann, chair­wo­m­an of the Ge­sellschaft für Mod­erne Kunst, of­fered the fol­low­ing state­ment on the se­lec­tion of the artist: “The ju­ry was en­thu­si­as­tic about Tr­isha Don­nel­ly’s di­verse work, which re­sists in­ter­pre­ta­tion. With sculp­tures, draw­ings, per­for­mances, films, and pho­to­graphs, she cre­ates works that lead us as view­ers in­to en­tire­ly dif­fer­ent spheres of per­cep­tion. Her con­sis­ten­cy and rad­i­cal ap­proach to ques­tions of aes­thet­ics or re­cep­tion were an im­por­tant rea­son for hon­or­ing Tr­isha Don­nel­ly with the Wolf­gang Hahn Prize. This is very much in keep­ing with the spir­it of Wolf­gang Hahn, who saw the con­nec­tion be­tween life and art in the avant-garde.”
Suzanne Cot­ter, di­rec­tor of the Ser­ralves Mu­se­um of con­tem­po­rary art in Por­to: “The Wolf­gang-Hahn Prize is one of the most in­spir­ing awards for con­tem­po­rary artists of its kind, and it is with enor­mous plea­sure that the prize this year goes to Tr­isha Don­nel­ly. Tr­isha Don­nel­ly is with­out doubt one of the most com­pelling artists of our time whose work of­fers en­tire­ly new ways of ex­pe­ri­enc­ing and think­ing about form, at once sy­naes­th­esic and dis­rup­tive­ly tran­s­port­ing. As an artist she oc­cu­pies a po­si­tion of com­mitt­ed re­sis­tance to the easy ap­pro­pri­a­tion of art as some­thing con­tained and ul­ti­mate­ly con­trol­lable. At the same time, the ex­traor­d­i­nary generos­i­ty of her work, that touch­es on the vi­su­al – in par­tic­u­lar the pho­to­graph­ic – , the spo­ken, the au­ral and the phys­i­cal, is elec­tri­fy­ing in its per­mis­sion.”
Yil­maz Dziewior, di­rec­tor of the Mu­se­um Lud­wig: “For us as an in­sti­tu­tion whose mis­sion is to col­lect con­tem­po­rary art, the pre­sen­ta­tion of the prize to Tr­isha Don­nel­ly is ex­cel­lent news. I have fol­lowed Tr­isha’s work close­ly for years; she brings the problem that artists have long worked on—­name­ly, what the very con­cept of an art­work mean­s—in­to the fu­ture. Her in­de­pen­dence and re­sis­tance to all forms of ap­pro­pri­a­tion are es­sen­tial el­e­ments of her work, as is her abil­i­ty to ad­just to the spe­cif­ic ex­hi­bi­tion venue and con­text, on­ly to over­turn ev­ery­thing, to dis­pense with any con­text of mean­ing, and to di­rect­ly ap­peal to the view­er. The Wolf­gang Hahn Prize thus once again sets new stan­dards by rec­og­niz­ing an ex­traor­d­i­nary and pi­oneer­ing artist.”
BAUWENS and Eb­n­er Stolz, two lo­cal com­pa­nies in Cologne, will cont­in­ue their long-term sup­port of the award cer­e­mony in 2017 as well as the ex­hi­bi­tion at the Mu­se­um Lud­wig and the publi­ca­tion. In 2016 both com­pa­nies agreed to gener­ous­ly sup­port the Wolf­gang Hahn Prize for at least three years.
