Maria Loboda (b. 1979) has made a specialty of digging into obscure histories—and inventing them too. The artist’s installations sit at the intersection of intrigue, fiction, the esoteric, and archaeological research, nearly always departing from a seemingly overlooked detail that she renders central, fantastical, and always unforgettable.
The exhibition is generously supported by the Ernst &amp; Olga Gubler-Habluetzel Foundation and is made in partnership with the Adam Mickiewicz Institute.
