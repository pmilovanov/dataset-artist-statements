KIOSK opens the new season with ‘Growth’, a solo exhibition by Brussels-based Canadian artist Zin Taylor (1978). Taylor’s work is often rooted in narrative structures that are translated into sculptures, drawings, graphic works, performances and video works.
Taylor’s investigative attitude points to a remarkable fascination for natural forms which he transposes to sculpture through the use of traditional techniques, artisan methods and sculptural principles. It is this, the very nature of sculpture, that the title of the exhibition alludes to; the organic development of form. The works on display in ‘Growth’ can thus be seen as variations on one central question: how does form materialize? How do works of art grow?
The artist’s ongoing inquiry into the development of a fundamental, sculptural form as a densely layered and organically growing process finds one of its most outspoken realizations in ‘The Bakery of Blok’, a work from 2009 that will be reinterpreted for KIOSK’s central hemicycle room. This installation, consisting of a series of materialist ‘units’, unfolds a complex narrative that interacts with the exhibition’s architecture.
