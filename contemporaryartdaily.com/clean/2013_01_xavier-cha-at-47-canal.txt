“I have a lot of ocular damage, like those clouds. I have some really consistent ones. Sometimes I go long periods of time without acknowledging or paying attention to them. It wire brushes your sensory, wire brushes off your jaded interaction with your senses, with my own senses. I haven’t compartmentalized not seeing I am seeing the cloudiness in my vision, before my vision. It’s like I can step back a phase in my ocular nerves. I’m able to see with my eyes again, what is inside of them.”
“I really missed someone. Really missed this person.”
