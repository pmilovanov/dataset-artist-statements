The exhibition how to write 1 features artworks by George Brecht from 1972:Corner, Front and Steal Me, which consist of white letters on white canvases, as well as the object Foxfire. We intend to publish a how to write-booklet with one of his texts.
The Piece of Wood (2005) by Jimmie Durham is also being shown in the exhibition. The work consists of a piece of wood and a text, where the piece of wood tells its story.
The Japanese artist Shimabuku is presenting two works. The video installationHow do you accept something you don’t understand? (2006/08) shows how a German is singing a Japanese song which she doesn’t understand and whose lyrics she has been learning by heart; and in Octopus Stone (2013) Shimabuku documents with found stones and shells the inexplicable passion for collecting that is characteristic for octopuses.
We present also books by Gertrude Stein – a cross-section of her writings from different periods. Her works will be on display in the bookshop, where one can also listen to audio-pieces – texts by Gertrude Stein read by the writer herself.
Two new tapestries by Ingrid Wiener are being shown as well: Einkaufsliste für Whitehorse and E, both dating from 2012. With the woven shopping list Wiener continues her work with remnants of life that she developed in a series of tapestries and installations together with Dieter Roth. In E, a psychological phenomenon of perception is being woven.
From Haegue Yang we present the installation Holiday for Tomorrow (2007). It consists of traditional Korean wooden screens of differing patterns as well as the film Holiday Story. Holiday Story was shot in Seoul during the Korean national holiday Chuseok. It shows one of the quietest days of the year when the city is deserted. A dense spoken text accompanies the film, reflecting on the topic of work and rest.
