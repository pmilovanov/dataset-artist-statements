KISH KUSH is the last installment of a trilogy of exhibitions Sarah Ortmeyer
has shown over the past two years.
Lining the gallery walls are 21 large scale prints, blushing portraits of the most successful
international female chess players, making love to the camera (GRANDMASTER I–XII,
WORLD CHAMPION I–IX). On the floor stand 6 sculptures made from discarded trade magazines
and ping pong balls, ogling the players on the wall (MAGNUS MAGNET I-VI).
They are surrounded by 416 marble and onyx chess figurines of diverse sizes
(KISH KUSH) that are reminiscent of fans encroaching on the space and
on the exhibits.
KISH KUSH takes various elements from the exhibitions at the SMAK (Ghent, Belgium) and Haus
Wittgenstein (Vienna, Austria) and recombines them, culminating in a spatial installation that
encompasses the spirit of chess, sportsmanship, shame and the cult of victory:
