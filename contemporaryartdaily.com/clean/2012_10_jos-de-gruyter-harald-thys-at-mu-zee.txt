This summer, the work of the Belgian artists Jos de Gruyter (b. Geel, 1965) and Harald Thys (b. Wilrijk, 1966) can be seen in Mu.ZEE with the exhibition Objects As Friends.
Jos de Gruyter and Harald Thys have worked together since the middle of the 1980s. Their work is characterised by a feeling of burlesque joy, childlike simplicity and a sense of humour: foolishness and inertia predominate. There is, however, a dark element present in their oeuvre that lays bare paradoxical emotions and critical reflections on the position of the artist in the 21st century.
Objects As Friends brings together 300 photographic works through which both artists provide an insight into their artistic position within the landscape of contemporary art. Mu.ZEE has acquired the entire exhibition for the collection and, as well as publishing a book, is showing the photographs for the first time in Belgium.
This exhibition is the result of a collaboration between the Kestnergesellschaft in Hannover, the Culturgest in Porto and Mu.ZEE.
