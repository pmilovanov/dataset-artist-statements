Galerie Gisela Capitain is pleased to announce its second solo exhibition with Austrian artist Elfie Semotan.
Elfie Semotan, who gained attention as a photographer with her unconventional ad campaigns, fashion photography, and portraits, has chosen still life as the subject of her most recent work. In these new works, the artist finds her imagery by casting an especially attentive and sensitive gaze upon often overlooked and everyday objects. She delicately documents found, seemingly coincidental constellations among her immediate surroundings. Semotans view of the things around her is not dictated by an internalized, learnt way of seeing, but is rather one that is very much personal and intuitive. Unusual perspectives, and especially light, are characteristic aspects of her new compositions. The fall of light and cast shadows lend the objects a presence that exceeds their own physical boundaries. Semotans interest in structures, graphic forms, and specific similarities are all further important compositional aspects. Her still lifes are often indecipherable at first glance, rendering their recognizable references to reality momentarily enigmatic. Yet, Semotan does not seek to give everyday objects heightened importance through staging. Rather, she explores her surroundings in a visual way, making occurrences and situations normally afforded no special importance, visible. Semotans personal sensitivity and intuitive perception of her surroundings thus become formative moments in the creation of still lifes that are, at times, poetic.
I react very personally to the inconspicuous and the overlooked. By photographing such things I elevate them to a level at which they can be seen, and correspondingly become beautiful and meaningful making it important to see them. (Elfie Semotan) 
Elfie Semotan, born in Wels, Upper Austria, in 1941, lives and works in New York, Vienna, and Jennersdorf, Austria.
