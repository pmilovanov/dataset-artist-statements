In order to copy something I look at myself and my neighbourhood.
In front of the gallerist
the young assistant explains the available objects
to a man and a woman.
The assistant explains, using words he learned in school.
This goes on and on.
At wich point the gallerist interrupts and says,
“I like the red picture”.
The man is pleased to hear this and says,
“I like the green picture”.
