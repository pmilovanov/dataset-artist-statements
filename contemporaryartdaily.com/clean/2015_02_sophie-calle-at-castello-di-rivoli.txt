A new important exhibition project marks the Castello di Rivoli’s march towards its thirtieth anniversary. Once again it proposes an international event that includes – as is the Museum’s tradition – something that goes beyond a mere collaboration with a prestigious artist to become a veritable challenge, a confrontation on the artist’s part with a venue full of history, to be related with his/her own past and stories, with personal experiences that are themes in works and research. This is the case for the important exhibition the Castello dedicates to the famous French artist Sophie Calle, an unchallenged protagonist on the world art scene, who will present a totally site-specific project for the monumental halls on the second floor of the Sabauda Residence. The exhibition concept focuses on two important projects the artist has carried forth for some years now: Rachel, Monique and Voir la mer. The comparison of these significant projects proposes two itineraries that are both distinct and united, including works that revolve around themes of affection and emotion, of death, of the analogy mother|sea (madre|mare) at the root of this exhibition’s title: a sea that welcomes and gathers, covers and invests an immensity of contrasting feelings and emotions.
This artist has always worked with topics such as detaching from a loved one, relationship break-ups, intimate life in general, and is able to effectively render not only the emotions but also the philosophical side, the reflection these arouse, accompanying the cultural elaboration of personal experience through such precise organization that may even seem obsessive, made of objects, videos, and texts: a sort of mise en place and theatre arrangement without scene performance. A process of appropriation through images where visitors, if they feel lost, may rediscover a course and in the end make it their own, like in a role-play novel.
