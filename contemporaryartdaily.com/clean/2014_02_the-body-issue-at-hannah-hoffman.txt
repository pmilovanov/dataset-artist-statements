The Body Issue presents a selection of images curated by New York based artist Frank Benson. The exhibition is organized around three guiding principles: all of the photos include the human figure as a subject, each photo was shot using a similar sharply focused style, and each artist is represented by a single work. While none of the images are appropriated the visual language of each photograph is rooted in the immediately readable style of commercial photography; yet all of the images offer a subtle perversion of that standard. Unlikely subjects, odd angles and uneasy compositions are employed to create uncanny representations of the body that continue to resonate long after the viewer has left the gallery.
