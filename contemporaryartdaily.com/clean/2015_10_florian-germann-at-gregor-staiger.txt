Galerie Gregor Staiger is pleased to announce Florian Germann’s exhibition ‘Heavy Rain‘. The show comprises two large sculptural works cast in polyester, a series of smaller wall works in polyoxymethylene and nylon, as well as a video. While previous work cycles made use of complex narrative links, the work in ‘Heavy Rain’ relies more heavily on relationships pertaining to material properties, shaping and state changes. Liquids play a central role as material, theme and morphology in a circular construction pump-ing a light pink solution clockwise, a video of slow moving immiscible fluids, a fountain turned on its head and suspended from the ceiling, and relief–like sculptures resembling three–dimensional Rohrschach blots shaped after small puddles from molten ice cubes. There remains an underlying narrative and many cues taken from previous work cycles exploring geology and natural history, but the new work is distilled into something more purely sculptural, more irreducible.
