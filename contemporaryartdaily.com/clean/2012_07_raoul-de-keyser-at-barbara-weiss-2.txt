Galerie Barbara Weiss is pleased to announce the exhibition, To Walk, presenting 17 new works by the internationally acclaimed Belgian painter Raoul De Keyser. A catalogue will accompany the exhibition with a text by Belgian writer Paul De Moor.
Raoul De Keyser’s new assemblage of works takes us through a series of modestly scaled oil paintings of successive images in process. Beginning with Gate, 2011, a blue entryway with a black frame on white ground and finalizing with Untitled, 2012, a canvas partially mounted on wood, the paintings draw from the artist’s surroundings leaving us with a sublime yet subtle multiplicity of sensations.
Raoul De Keyser, often referred to as a painter’s painter, has had many important solo exhibitions in renowned institutions including Kunstmuseum Bonn, Portikus, Frankfurt/Main, Kunsthalle Bern, The Renaissance Society, Chicago, Whitechapel Gallery, London and Kunstmusem St.Gallen.
