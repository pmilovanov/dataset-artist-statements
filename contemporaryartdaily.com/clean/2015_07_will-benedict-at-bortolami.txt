Bortolami is pleased to announce A Bone in the Cheese, our first solo exhibition with Will Benedict.
The exhibition centers around a new video by Benedict entitled The Bed That Eats; a portrait of an unmade bed singing a song of the same title by the reductive blues duo Stare Case. While the video is in the strictest sense a portrait of a bed, the video also takes the viewer inside the bed and down into the bowels of a yellowing underworld where insides become outsides.
Alongside the video, Benedict will show a series of new paintings featuring an indignant chicken, an obese marmot, and a tender gorilla while dry yellowing landscapes echo the underworld of the disemboweled, a kitchen attempts and fails to remain neutral, and several people are pictured going about their day.
While acknowledging a skewed moral compass, Benedict offers approaches to relevant everyday subjects such as the psychology of production and the consumer state.
