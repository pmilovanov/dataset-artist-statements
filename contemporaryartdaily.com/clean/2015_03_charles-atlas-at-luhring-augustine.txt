Luhring Augustine is pleased to announce the opening of The Waning of Justice, a solo exhibition by the influential American film and video artist Charles Atlas. This will be Atlas’ second solo exhibition with the gallery; his first gallery exhibition, The Illusion of Democracy, was the inaugural show at our Bushwick space in February 2012.
Atlas is a pioneering figure in film and video; for over four decades he has stretched the limits of his medium, forging new territory in a far-reaching range of genres, stylistic approaches, and techniques. Throughout his production, Atlas has consistently been deeply involved in fostering collaborative relationships, working intimately with such significant artists and performers as Leigh Bowery, Michael Clark, Douglas Dunn, Marina Abramovic, Yvonne Rainer, Mika Tajima/ New Humans, Antony and the Johnsons, and most notably Merce Cunningham, with whom he worked closely from the early 1970s until the choreographer’s death in 2009.
The Waning of Justice will include all new work made by the artist for this exhibition. Several autonomous video works will all be synchronized by imagery, duration, and soundtrack to create one dynamic visual experience. The videos in the exhibition feature sunsets shot by Atlas in Florida while at the Rauschenberg Residency; in varying pieces, the sunsets are interwoven with found footage, graphic effects, and other elements.
