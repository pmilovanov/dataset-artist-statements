Last winter, Calla Henkel and Max Pitegoff photographed in startup offices around Berlin, forming relationships that held the promise of longevity. Networks; stronger than last names, stronger than addresses, stronger than phone numbers. During their visits, the conversations often turned towards why Henkel and Pitegoff were there, not to photograph, but in Berlin. The defensive language of promise became a backdrop for the images they produced. “Berlin is a green field, when you give creative people green fields they do amazing things.” The artists nodded, listening, complicit, thankful for lax visa policies (for Americans) and online burgeramt appointments. Hanging on the walls of VI, VII are images of consumption and connectivity (cheesy strings). The photographs accompany a narrative written by Henkel and Pitegoff.
