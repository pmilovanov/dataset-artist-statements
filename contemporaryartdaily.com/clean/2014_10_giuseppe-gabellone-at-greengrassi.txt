greengrassi is pleased to present Giuseppe Gabelloneâ€™s fifth exhibition at the gallery. The show comprises new work featuring an expansive, padded fabric floor piece and two pencil wall drawings occupying opposite walls of the gallery.
In each body of work a system is devised by the artist and put into practice in order for the pieces to move from an idea into material objects. The process of their making is embedded in the reading of the completed work. Both succeed in exalting the relationship between material, surface and shape questioning the monumental and the decorative sensibility inherent in both sculpture and drawing.
