Here we see, the zebra has a new trick up her sleeve. While old friends are seen from the outside only, new friends mingle and meet inside showcasing new and familiar marks and strokes. Form and fantasy come to the forefront with practicality thrown to the wayside. You can look but you cannot sit. You can also roll your view up and down, according to your shifting moods and tastes. Anything goes but don’t expect the moves to be easy.
