Fran√ßois Ghebaly presents The Third Floor, an Exhibition of new work by Los Angeles based artist Patrick Jackson. For this exhibition Jackson has installed scaffolding that divides the gallery into three levels. Each floor is installed different effect, creating an ominous and psychologically loaded space.
The basement level is set with a variety of oversized ceramic vessels. Most have a black cracking glaze that looks similar to burnt wood, but the giant mugs of the group come in an intense variety of colors, textures and patterns. Each mug holds an assortment of things, such as dirt clumps, soda colored epoxy and resin crystals.
The ground floor is lined with white carpeting and lit with daylight bulbs creating a very bright white room, an uncanny gallery space. There is one floor piece and three wall works in this section.
On the top floor stands, Black Statue, a five-foot figure, with body, clothing and hair all a shade of black. The eyes themselves are black holes that burrow into the body.
Jackson invited artist Mitchell Syrop to install a text piece on the exterior all of the gallery; it reads: THERE IS NO DEVICE TO RECORD IT.
