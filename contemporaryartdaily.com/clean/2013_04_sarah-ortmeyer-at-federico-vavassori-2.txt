Sarah Ortmeyer (b.1980) is a graduate of St√§delschule and lives in Vienna, Austria. Her work has been exhibited at institutions worldwide, most recently at S.M.A.K Museum of Contemporary Art (Ghent); MAK Center (Los Angeles); Museum of Modern Art (Warsaw) and KW Institute (Berlin).
With MACHO AMORE, Ortmeyer conjures up the choreographed hostility of Milans two rival soccer teams in a series of intricate draperies. Presented in eleven frames traditionally used to individually display similar sports garments and resist bar brawls, the jerseys from both teams are here intertwined in a precarious equilibrium. The exhibition introduces a new version of INTERNATIONALISMUS, a swarming arrangement of eighty-one embroidered baseball caps first presented at Kunstverein Heilbronn in 2010. Part of the show takes also place at CAFE BAR SPORT, via Melzo 11.
