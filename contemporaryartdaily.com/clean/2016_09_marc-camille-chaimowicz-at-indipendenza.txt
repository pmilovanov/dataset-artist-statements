Indipendenza is very pleased to host the first exhibition in Rome by Marc Camille Chaimowicz since his stay at the British School at Rome in 1998. Tailored for the different rooms of the exhibition space, the show «Now and Then» Ora e Allora... in Italian – was conceived with curator Eva Svennung as a journey through different aspects and moments of the artist’s work.
By inviting the viewer to delve into the parallel worlds which the artist has long been elaborating, the show engages the visitor in a joyful revision of the status of the works presented. Prompted by the specific exhibition environment which Indipendenza induces, older pieces are now in dialogue with current proposals; speculations around pieces or more ample projects still to materialize or not. New works but also new renderings divert from a certain tendency to commodify practice, manifesting instead a many-layered approach to the décor the artist was invited to temporarily occupy. Hence the fluidity embodied by The Small Vehicles of Rome (1998), now seemingly punctuating the show and the openness to the various possible « devenirs » of the proposals at hand, which are inherent to the work and to the artist’s habit of reshuffling situations. A mischievous stance perhaps, but one that prevents the work from being encapsulated and narrowed down, prolonging instead a timeless and precious sense of suspension and reverie.
«Now and Then» features works by Becky Beasley, Clémence Joly and Marie Charlotte Urena.
