Konrad Fischer Galerie Berlin is pleased to announce the opening of an exhibition of work by Jan Dibbets on Friday, May 1 2009, from 6 to 9pm.
Besides selected works from the series Land And Sea Horizons (2007) we will exhibit five Windows from the 1980s and 1990s. As already seen in his early PerspectiveCorrections (1968) the later work of Dibbets is still concerned with the contradictions of our concepts of reality and their pictorial realization in photography.
Jan Dibbets series Land And Sea Horizons juxtaposes photographs of dunes and ocean, each mounted in different shapes and formats. The viewer sees simultaneously what would be in front of and what would be behind him in a real landscape. This experience is further stimulated by the fact that although the panels are pieced together in different ways, the horizon line always remains level and constant.
Also Dibbets Windows question the angle of vision from which we perceive reality through images today: a reality presumably existing in the objective sense, and another reality that we are able to create as a pure fiction in our minds. If some of Dibbets earlier works have already juxtaposed the indexical and the iconic dimensions of photography, this strategy is fully realized in the Windows series. Photographs of windows are isolated through a process of cut-outs and then enlarged. These images then are mounted on paper and surrounded by a monochrome field of paint. The light eminating through the windows is contrasted by the actual light that is reflected by the painted surface. Icon and Index are playing off each other and finally seem to become the flipside of the same coin.
