What is found here?
A threshold before the stage,
where shadows meet spotlight.
“When the past seems to cease and the future to stall” Actors prepare for their performances
in a room filled with shrubs
When we speak, it is as though we lay momentary claim to something that does not belong to us
What belongs to us?
The force of our breath, our tongue, the backs of our teeth.
