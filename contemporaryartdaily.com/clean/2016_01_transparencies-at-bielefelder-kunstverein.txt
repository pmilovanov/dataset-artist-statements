The exhibition project »Transparencies« examines the cultural facets and atmospheres of this (non-)transparency. While modern life is characterized by a desire for more transparency in communication, politics and business, limitless access to information has eroded personal privacy, creating an ever-present, now long-running social dilemma. The two-part, joint exhibition project in Bielefeld and Nuremberg is dedicated to developments in »transparent society,« and asks how these are reflected in current work by contemporary artists.
In the run-up to the exhibition, the graphic design studio Metahaven developed its own visual identity for »Transparencies« with a family of logotypes.* Considerations on the topic continue in the form of a symposium, a series of exhibition talks, workshops, and a shared project website (Design by Christoph Knoth and Konrad Renner). 
On the one hand, »Transparencies« attempts to locate and update the phenomenon in cultural history, yet it also enables an understanding of the (borderline) experiences of this new visibility from a contemporary perspective. The project concludes with the publication of a comprehensive catalogue (featuring texts by Emmanuel Alloa, Clare Birchall, Manfred Schneider, among others).
Curators: Simone Neuenschwander and Thomas Thiel
