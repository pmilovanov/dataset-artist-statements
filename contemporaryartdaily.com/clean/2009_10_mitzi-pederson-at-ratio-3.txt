Ratio 3 is pleased to present Ill Start Again, new work by Mitzi Pederson, on view from September 11 to October 24, 2009.
Ill Start Again includes new work using common materials such as wood, paper, sand and string. These materials are manipulated, balanced and situated to create sculptures and drawings, which further explore states of permanence, tension, and happenstance. With this body of work, Pederson aims to integrate new material approaches and combinations to her continued exploration of space, form and relationship. The work involves an attempt to blend drawing and sculpture by mixing the use of line, color, material and space. She navigates the occupation of space with suggestion of form and absence of solidity. The work also investigates how to permit the materials inherent tendencies to exist within the situated states imposed on them.
Mitzi Pederson was born in 1976 in Stuart, Florida. She received a B.F.A. from Carnegie Mellon University in 1999.
