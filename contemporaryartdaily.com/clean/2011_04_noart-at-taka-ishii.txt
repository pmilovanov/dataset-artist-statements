We would like to express our sympathy and deepest condolences to those and their families whom suffered the effect of the earthquake which struck the north-eastern pacific region of Japan on March 11th. We pray for the earliest possible restoration and recovery of those affected regions.
At Taka Ishii Gallery from March 30 – April 28, we will hold an exhibition entitled “NOART”, in commemoration to those whom suffered and lost their lives.
Within this instance, we painfully realized the powerlessness of art to deal with such extreme conditions. In contemplating the least of what we can do under such circumstances, we decided to hold the exhibition,“NOART”. Without exhibiting anything within the gallery space, we will present a single donation box in the space surrounded by its plain white walls. The donations gathered will be remitted from the gallery to the National Red Cross Society. We hope you will join us in presenting your donations.
In the meantime due to circumstances, the “Marijke van Wamerdam” exhibition scheduled to start from March 30 has been postponed until further notice. Please accept our sincerest apologies for the inconvenience caused towards those involved.
