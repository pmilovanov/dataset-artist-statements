In her exhibition, Ines Lechleitner shows a series of photographs displaying the region around the mountain massif La Chartreuse in France, bordering the monastery Grande Chartreuse founded by Bruno from Cologne. The traditional Selet cheese is hand-made in the cheese dairy Le Habert in Entremont-Le-Vieux. In the two larger photographs, Lechleitner simulates the cheesemakers view onto the mountain in the surrounding landscape and thereby mixes imagination/clich√©e and reality, natures form and its perception.
