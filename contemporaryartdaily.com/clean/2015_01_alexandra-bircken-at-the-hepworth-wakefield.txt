This autumn The Hepworth Wakefield presents Conflict and Collisions: New Contemporary Sculpture, an exciting programme of new contemporary art that features three new solo exhibitions and commissions by artists Alexandra Bircken, Folkert de Jong and Toby Ziegler.
This will be the first institutional UK solo show for each artist. Coinciding with this year’s WW1 commemorations, each exhibition considers themes of historical and contemporary combat and of man versus machine, with handmade and hand-finished objects opposing mechanical weaponry, state-of-the art digital technologies and 3D printing.
German artist Alexandra Bircken presents a series of recent works that showcase a new approach in her practice, as well as a new site-specific commission for The Hepworth Wakefield. Her exhibition includes B.U.F.F, 2014, comprising four component works (Big, 2014; Ugly, 2014; Fat, 2014; Fellow, 2014 that collectively refer to the American B-52 bombers, used by the United States Air Force from the 1950s, as well as Mercedes gear-sticks and a leather demolition ball. Her new installation features ‘leather skins’ draped on a series of intersecting ladders, which allude to Barbara Hepworth’s iconic ‘stringed sculptures’ that can be found elsewhere in The Hepworth Wakefield.
