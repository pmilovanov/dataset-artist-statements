Humans all bet with their lives their life story is one big gamble. No ones life is the answer but some people are very lucky. People want to share that luck. From my observations over the years, the luckiest ones are the chosen ones.
I dont understand why more people dont risk. Risk is only the potential of losing something valuable. But who cares if its risky so long as its interesting error is just a suspension of truth anyways. Truth, we all have enough time to get.
