A Needle Walks into a Haystack is an exhibition about our habits, our habitats, and the objects, images, relationships and activities that constitute our immediate surroundings. It’s about effecting larger questions facing contemporary life and art, from an intimate and tangible scale that’s within everyday reach.
The artists in this exhibition disrupt many of the conventions and assumptions that usually prescribe the way we live our lives. They attack the metaphors, symbols and representations that make up their own environment, replacing them with new meanings and protocols: bureaucracy becomes a form of comedy, silence becomes a type of knowledge, domesticity becomes a place of pathology, inefficiency becomes a necessary vocation, and delinquency becomes a daily routine.

Alongside the group show, A Needle Walks into a Haystack will features solo presentations:

• St Andrews Gardens will host a series of screenings and conversations around the work of experimental Belgian TV director, Jef Cornelis For A Needle Walks into a Haystack, Koen Brams (BE) has selected films by Cornelis for viewers to watch on televisions, not only introducing a UK audience to this important and recalcitrant figure, but also serving as a place for conversations about what television can be and how this medium can be used to document and represent art.
As part of A Needle Walks into a Haystack there will also be an ambitious programme of talks, screenings and other events throughout the Biennial period. Over the weekend of 19-21 September, a programme of performances titled The Companion will take place, which will mirror and reflect on various times of the day: artists appear in cafés during breakfast, at bus stops during the morning commute, in a pharmacy during an afternoon errand, or in a theatre right after dinner.
Also featured as part of Liverpool Biennial 2014 are the John Moores Painting Prize, Bloomberg New Contemporaries and Not all documents are records at Open Eye Gallery and Adrian Henri at the Exhibition Research Centre at Liverpool John Moores University. In addition, there is work by artists and curators in solo and group shows and performances throughout the city, ranging from the artist-run space The Royal Standard to Metal and the Walker Art Gallery.
In parallel to the Biennial Exhibition, the Biennial also presents a co-commission with Tate Liverpool and 14-18 NOW, the official cultural programme for the First World War Centenary Commemorations. Venezuelan artist, Carlos Cruz-Diez, has painted a version of a ‘Dazzle Ship’, in partnership with National Museums Liverpool. The Edmund Gardner vessel, conserved in Merseyside Maritime Museum, has been ‘dazzled’ in a dry dock adjacent to Albert Dock Liverpool.
A highlight of the opening weekend is a major concert at Liverpool Cathedral on the evening of Saturday 5 July of a specially composed new work by Michael Nyman, Symphony No 11: Hillsborough Memorial. The piece will be performed by the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra, with Liverpool-born mezzo-soprano Kathryn Rudge and Liverpool Philharmonic Youth and Training Choirs, conducted by Josep Vicent.
