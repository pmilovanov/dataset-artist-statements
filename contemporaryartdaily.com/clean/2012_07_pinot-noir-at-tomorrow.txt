At almost all wine tastings, except those where the wines are of the highest quality, spitting after each taste is customary. Even the most amateurish sommelier has his own unique routine.
Yet, no matter how carefully you spit, alcohol is inevitably absorbed through the lining of the mouth, and, throughout the course of a tasting, your capacity for criticism tends to suffer.
Pinot Noir is the name of the one-year anniversary show at Tomorrow Gallery and an increasingly popular variety of wine.
