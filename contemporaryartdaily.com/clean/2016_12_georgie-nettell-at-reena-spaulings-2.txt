Contemporary citizens are able to shield themselves from the disagreeable aspects of life, building walls around spaces of private life amid the bustling metropolis. These living spaces reflect the interior world of the individual, the home is an expression of the personality, what you put on your walls represents who you are or want to be.
Here a range of framed posters aim away from the avant-garde towards the domestic, or towards the simulated intimacy of a cafe or Airbnb apartment.
The familiar drone of warring subjectivities is present in this selection of miscellaneous tastes sentiments loyalties and emotions. Icons to identify with, cling to or be repulsed by are dropped into the same graphic format. No longer neutral but still distressed, the tedium of stability has given way to something else. Polarized agents scroll through a myriad of false binaries, searching for a campaign that defines them, free to choose, but only between the available options.
