Geta Brătescu (*1926 in Ploiești, Romania) has over the decades dealt in various media with questions of memory and history, artistic identity, literary figures and topics, and not least with the legacy of modernism. Drawing and collage have remained her companions ever since and still form the foundation of her practice. In the last years she dedicated herself with great intensity to brightly colored paper collages she considers as “drawing with scissors”. Conceived like test assemblies, these cut-outs modulate the relationships between color, line and plane in formal plays. But Brătescu doesn´t restrict herself to paper, textiles and other everyday materials are used as well. The exhibition comprises works of serial character and individual works from the recent past and is complemented by a group of drawings from the 1970s.
In April 2016, a retrospective of Brătescu´s work is inaugurated at the Hamburger Kunsthalle.
Further exhibitions in recent years include: Tate Liverpool (2015, solo); CAM, St. Louis (2015, solo); MoMA, New York (2014); MUSAC, León (2013, solo); Musée d´Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris, Paris (2013); La Biennale di Venezia, Venedig (2013); 5th Moscow Biennale of Contemporary Art, Moskau (2013); Salonul de Proiecte, Bukarest (2012, solo); Tate Modern, London (2012); Istanbul Biennial, Istanbul (2011); MACBA, Barcelona (2011); New Museum, New York (2011); MUMOK, Wien (2011).
