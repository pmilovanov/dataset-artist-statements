Max Brand (* 1982 at Leipzig, Germany) is using a wide spectrum of materials at his dense compositions: with spray-color, ball pen, calk and chlorine bleach he develops painted visions of form and figure in a careful manner which conserves the sensible dimensions of experience and memory. Therefore the center of his art is roughly sketched constellations and visualized ciphers of his thoughts. By borrowing the omnipresent motives from our everyday life culture Max Brand crosses over his unconscious traces with popular fragments of our visual culture. At the works of Max Brand we encounter utterances of disordered thinking in all its confusing and overlapping ways.
