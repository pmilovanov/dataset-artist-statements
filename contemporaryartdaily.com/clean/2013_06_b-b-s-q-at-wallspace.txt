Wallspace is pleased to present B.B.S.Q., a group exhibition that brings together the work of Math Bass, Lucas Blalock, Michael Queenland and Andreas Slominski. The title and spirit of the exhibition play on (and nod to) Duchampâ€™s L.H.O.O.Q., engaging with notions of the readymade, the body and the often surreal and absurd spaces in between. Furthermore, all of these works evince a studied exploration of the thresholds of their mediums, pushing against the edges as both a strategy of discovery and a locus of meaning.
