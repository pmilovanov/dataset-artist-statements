For Codax’s Shoot the Lobster exhibition at Michael Thibault, the artist will present a new collection of monochrome paintings. This is the artists first show on the West Coast following recent solo and two­person exhibitions at Gavin Browns Enterprise (NYC), Martos Gallery (NYC), Carriage Trade (NYC), and Galerie Susanna Kulli (Zurich).
