For the second cycle of their year-long exhibition programme at -1, The Ister invites the Berlin-based curatorial project Dingum.
Converting the gallery space into a mis-en-scène of a restaurant, A Matter of Taste“ imagines a place where personal taste, art, consumption and decoration become one.
With works by Marie Angeletti, Will Benedict, Henning Bohl, Vittorio Brodmann, Lisa Holzer, Tom Humphreys, Jonas Lipps, and Dena Yago.
Dingum is a curatorial project founded 2011 by Hannes Schmidt and Dennis Oliver Schroer in Berlin. The program reflects an interest in time-based, performative works and a contextual shift from art into spaces of the everyday, ranging from modernist office spaces and roman gardens to local restaurants.
