greengrassi is pleased to show ‘THE BARRY THORPE COLLECTION OF 20TH CENTURY AMERICAN MUSIC BY ALLEN RUPPERSBERG 2014 (VOL.1)’, 2014.
Barrie H. Thorpe (b.1925), was a single man who lived in his birthplace and occupied his childhood home until his death in 2012. He was born in Aurora, Illinois, 42 miles West of Chicago. He served as an infantryman in the United States Army during WWII. Thorpe was decorated with a Purple Heart and two Battle Stars, for injuries sustained in combat while in France, Belgium and Germany in 1944-45.
Thorpe began collecting 78rpm records at the age of 12 and continued to do so until his death at 87. As a Post-War adult, he earned his livelihood as a salesman for various companies. He traveled a prescribed territory in the Midwest where he found and grew the bulk of his collection.
The collection has a predominant focus on recordings and pressings that originated in the United States. All genres of music and spoken word are represented, in all the popular pressing formats: 78, 45, and 33rpm. The collection is a veritable history of recording in the 20th century.
As a means to document his collection, Thorpe himself typed each index card in the card catalogue and prepared typed journals; listing each record or series of records by the artist or musical group who performed on the recording.
