“Days and Nights,” an exhibition of new paintings by Dan Walsh, will open at the Paula Cooper Gallery (521 West 21st Street) on Friday, February 19, and remain on view through March 27, 2010.
Walsh is known for paintings that employ linear geometry while at the same time subverting it with irregularly drawn shapes, inconstant lines and a pervasive wit. Over time, Walsh’s formal (yet purposefully casual) vocabulary has tended to concentrate around the repetition of simple strokes forming intricate, visually striking patterns, such as punctuated lines, cross-hatched grids, concentric squares and collapsed diamonds. Despite their layered complexity, Walsh’s paintings make no mystery of their process. They are “proposals” presenting various options, or ways in which programmatic ideas are realized. They suggest the shifting balance between the amount of control exerted over an image and the freedom or flexibility to let the image veer off in its own direction.
The exhibition includes six to eight new paintings, as well as a multipanel project titled Days and Nights, which will function as an experimental, self-reflective chart of Walsh’s own tangling with his painting process.
Dan Walsh was born in 1960. His work has been exhibited in national and international venues, including the New Museum of Contemporary Art in New York, P.S.1 Contemporary Art Center in Long Island City, the Centre national d’art contemporain in Nice, la Synagogue de Delme, France, CCNOA (Art + Architecture) in Brussels, Belgium and the Kunstverein Medienturm, Graz. His prints and limited-edition books were the subject of a one-person exhibition at the Cabinet des Estampes du Musée d’Art et d’histoire, in Geneva, Switzerland. He was also included in the Ljubljiana Biennial, Slovenia, and the Lyon Biennial of Contemporary Art, France.
