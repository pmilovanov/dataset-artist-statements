MISAKO &amp; ROSEN opened in December, 2006, in Kita-otsuka, Toshima city, Tokyo. MISAKO &amp; ROSEN is now 10 years old so we are looking back on 10 years of what weve done through curating this exhibition considering our roots. The show has a taste of the late 90s and early 2000s and is a cross section of our art experience in Tokyo and LA during the years before MISAKO &amp; ROSEN began to organize exhibitions. In the group of artists, there are common points which embody the period both as it was to us on the West Coast of the United States and in Japan. December is the first of multiple exhibitions which the we are organizing on and off-site to celebrate our 10th Anniversary.
