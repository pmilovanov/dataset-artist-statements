Born in 1950, Pierre Le-Tan is a painter and draftman. His drawings have been published by numerous magazines, including, at the age of nineteen, the prestigious New Yorker. They also illustrated covers of a hundred books, led in a long-term collaboration with Patrick Modiano, and appeared on film sets, in particular Quadrille by Valérie Lemercier. Pierre Le-Tan has always been living in images, as his father, Lê Phô, Vietnamese painter who established himself in Paris before War World II.
An Intérieur de fantaisie is exhibited in Air of Paris’ window, deploying a drawing which creates a mise en abyme into space and plays with the idea of frame, as well as mysterious old wooden measuring objects, a real frame and a set of drawings in the drawing. A metaphysical fantasy. Elsewhere, a series of recent drawings, produced on the occasion of a carte blanche from M — Le Monde Magazine. They display — not without irony — some black and white landscapes, as a multitude of superb Summer destinations.
