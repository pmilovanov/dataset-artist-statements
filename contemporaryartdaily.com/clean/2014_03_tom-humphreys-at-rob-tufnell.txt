Rob Tufnell presents an exhibition of new works by Tom Humphreys installed on both the inside and exterior of the gallery.
Trained as a sculptor, Tom Humphreys work is often discussed as painting but retains as sculptural sensibility. Conventional supports such as paper and canvas, and more unusual materials such as ceramic dinner plates, are variously collaged, painted, printed or drawn upon and assembled into improvised framed.
He uses both industrial materials and those of the artisan emulsion paint and artists pigment, permanent marker and charcoal. Works may also employ photography, upholstery foam and, most recently neon lights.
The title of the exhibition is appropriated from the phrase used for private guest houses in Cuba.
