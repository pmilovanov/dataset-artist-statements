Shot on colour 16mm film and presented as a short film as well as a flip book, Oyster is a minimalist cinematic poem showcasing the Native Oyster, Ostrea edulis. Oyster engages with various aspects of the molluscs history, life and consumption, while exploring how we imagine the sea and our relationship to it. The work unfolds the form and fragility of sea organisms, their capture and trade, and subtly questions the future ecology of its habitat and local trade. Oyster brings elements of modernism and abstraction to its natural subject, with an accompanying soundscape traversing Kentish dialect, electro pop, free jazz and silence. The accompanying flip book reconstructs the basic principles of filmmaking, whilst presenting another aspect of the oysters life.
