Listening is a two-person exhibition of hybrid sculptures by Berlin based artists Olga Balema and Anne de Vries. Created during the last two months in Los Angeles by Balema and de Vries, Listening draws from Southern Californias cultural, industrial, and geographical landscape to produce two discrete series of artworks that commonly represent the interior and exterior human form. While production techniques and formal qualities vary considerably between Balema and de Vries, the locus of Listening is a shared interest in the conceptual investigation of the human body.
