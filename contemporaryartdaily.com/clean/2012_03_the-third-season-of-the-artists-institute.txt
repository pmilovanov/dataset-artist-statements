The third season was dedicated to Jimmie Durham. We began in August with a talk by Carolyn Christov-Bakargiev; then heard a reading and lecture about Tiqqun by Jason E. Smith; saw Zin Taylors Flute of Sub performance and exhibition; showed Claire Fontaines Cherokee neon sign; heard curator Jo√£o Ribas talk about speculative realism and sound artist Florian Hecker perform his speculative solution; listened to an ensemble led by David Grubbs perform a score by Christian Wolff; saw Aki Sasamotos interactive lecture and installation; heard Charles Bernstein and Paolo Javier read poems; hosted the artist group Mahony; ate an meal conceived by Marina Zurkow; and ended with an exhibition about Jimmie Durham and Juan Sanchez in the 1980s in New York. Thank you.
