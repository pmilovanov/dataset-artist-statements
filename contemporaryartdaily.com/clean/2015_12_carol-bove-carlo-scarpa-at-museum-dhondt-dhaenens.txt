Carol Bove/Carlo Scarpa brings together a commissioned body of work by artist Carol Bove (Â°1971) with exhibition furniture and sculptures by the Venetian architect and exhibition designer Carlo Scarpa (1906-78). Using carefully chosen materials and choreographing display strategies to produce narrative, Bove and Scarpa share a concern with relationships between an object, its environment and the moment of sculptural encounter. Seen together for the very first time, the works of Bove and Scarpa question how objects and artworks are embedded within structures of meaning, emphasizing the importance of the direct and temporal encounter with sculpture.
Carol Bove / Carlo Scarpa is curated by the Henry Moore Institute, Leeds (England) and produced in collaboration with Museion, Bolzano (Italy) and the Museum Dhondt-Dhaenens.
