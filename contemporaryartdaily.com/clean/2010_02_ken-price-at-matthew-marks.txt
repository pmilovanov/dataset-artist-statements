Matthew Marks Gallery is pleased to announce an exhibition of new sculpture by Ken Price at 522 West 22nd Street. The exhibition comprises twelve sculptures, all made in 2009.
In the main gallery, Price will show three large-scale sculptures that continue the expansion of his practice into more monumental sizes, which he began working on shortly after his last exhibition at the gallery in 2006, in which he debuted his first large-scale piece.
Three additional galleries will be installed with nine smaller sculptures. All of the works, large and small, have meticulously hand-finished surfaces, slowly built up over time with as many as twenty layers of paint, which are then sanded to a satin polish.
The rich colors and painstakingly worked surfaces of Ken Prices sculptures have always been integral to his spectacular and inventive forms. In the newest pieces, the sensual shapes seem more alive then ever as they twist up and around or suggestively slump against one another.
Ken Price was born in Los Angeles in 1935. In 1959 he returned to Los Angeles after studying on the East Coast and quickly became part of the emerging Los Angeles art community that had grown around the Ferus Gallery, where he had his first one-person show in 1960. He has exhibited his work regularly since that time, including one-person museum exhibitions at the Menil Collection, Houston; the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York; the Walker Art Center, Minneapolis; and, most recently, the Chinati Foundation, Marfa. His work is the subject of an upcoming retrospective exhibition at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. Price now lives and works in New Mexico.
