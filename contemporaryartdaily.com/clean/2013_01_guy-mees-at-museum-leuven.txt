In 2012, M took over the management of Cera’s art collection.The two Leuven partners are collaborating to disclose the Cera Collection to the general public. The collection offers a unique cross-section of post- war Belgian art. It comprises approximately four hundred works by almost seventy Belgian artists, featuring both famous names and new, young talent in diverse media. Every year, M is presenting a room-scale exhibition from the collection that focuses on an artist or theme.The first collection presentation is based on the work of Guy Mees.
Guy Mees created sculptures, drawings, photographs, installations and films. The works by Mees acquired by Cera offer a sample of his diverse oeuvre, which spans a period of more than thirty years. His poetic and playful work engages in dialogue with the work of other artists in the Cera Collection: with contemporary Marthe Wéry, with Walter Swennen and with the younger artist Gert Robijns. One or more elements from Guy Mees’ oeuvre, such as the monochrome use of colour, the relationship with the space and the playful and fragmentary character of forms also recur in the work of these artists.
