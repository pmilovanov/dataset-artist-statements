Fine Arts, Sydney is presenting an exhibition of new work by Yngve Holen.
Yngve Holen’s work makes use of the materials and technologies of today’s industries and our everyday surroundings.
This exhibition comprises sculptures made from the face panels of Siemens SOMATOM Force CT scanners machines that create tomographic images from computer-processed X-rays, allowing users to see inside biological objects without cutting. The artist has exhibited works like these in various iterations since 2015. The sculptures in this exhibition present the CT scanner face panels cut into two diminished forms: one slimmed, the other globule. They are mounted to the wall, and have been painted in the colour of Paris’ new ‘Bagatelle’ public waste baskets.
The press communiqué for the Bagatelle describes how it is perfectly adapted to today’s urban environment:
1. 110L capacity to optimise waste collection
2. Double validation of Vigipirate for transparency and explosion-resistance
3. Easy and fast replacement of the keyless bag
4. High-yield-strength steel
5. No possible graffiti display
6. PMR compatible
7. No spare parts
8. Customisable logo
9. Possibility to adapt a lid
10. Optional ash tray
11. Fixable to ground or existing furniture
