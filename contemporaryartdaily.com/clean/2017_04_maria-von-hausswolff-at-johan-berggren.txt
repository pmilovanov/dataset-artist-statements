Alien Tourist is taking place during the night in the wilderness in the Northern part of Jutland. The scenes are revealed with moving light where the nature takes on the appearance of a sublime romantic landscape painting. Moving through fields, forests and sand dunes, the landscapes seams to blur together, to become one disoriented place where space and time is loosened and where suddenly human bodies appear in frozen positions, like sculptures.
