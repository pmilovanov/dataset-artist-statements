The seventh season of The Artist’s Institute is dedicated to Lucy McKenzie (b. 1977), a figure whose work, quite fittingly, plays with both terms—artist and institute. For McKenzie, inhabiting a particular genre or style, be it of painting, fashion, or literature, is an occasion to test the boundaries of artistic work and play with the armature of how an artist is produced.
McKenzie makes works drawn from the artistic milieu of the cities and social circles she inhabits. Early paintings appropriated the language of 1970s Scottish Muralism, while more recent projects have recon- structed famed domestic interiors by employing faux finishing techniques. McKenzie has also founded a record label, a bar, a fashion line, and is currently experimenting with the field of crime fiction. Each of these forms enables her to construct a world on her own terms, while avidly celebrating and supporting the artistic pursuits of those close to her.
In this new season, we dedicate ourselves not only to McKenzie, but to the coterie of friends and collaborators she brings with her, and to the friends and fellows that have been carrying artists’ conversations forward at The Artist’s Institute over the past three years. As always, stop by if you’re in the neighborhood.
