Office Baroque has the pleasure to present the first individual exhibition of Tyson Reeder at the gallery. Reeder will be presenting a suite of new paintings, a mix of colorful landscapes, figurative, and abstract paintings. Through experimental paint application techniques and using mixed media such as shells and coins in his art-making, in his words, Tyson is “temporarily suspending the burden of art history, with its myriad ways of contextualizing every type of painting move, to let accident and invention come into the process.”
Never out to twist arms, Tyson Reeder’s paintings guide us to the delights of seeing strangeness in the everyday. Reeder sees painting as an act of discovery and an offering of generosity and pleasure. Reeder is a colorist of subtly and odd emotive power. The soft pastel shades and the just slightly unexpected color choices of his palette undercut perfunctory and direct drawing. The paintings feature the curve of a shoreline, the outline of a chopper, or the orderly shelves of a shoe store, turning his attention to his day to day. The “picture-ness” of the paintings is frequently offset by hallucinatory abstract shapes or collaged elements including sheets of watercolor paper or smushed cotton balls that seem to imply fissures in reality. The effect is simultaneously eerie and reassuring.
Tyson Reeder currently lives in Chicago, USA. He has had solo exhibitions at CANADA, New York; Daniel Reich, New York; The Green Gallery, Milwaukee and Gavin Brown’s Enterprise, New York. His group exhibitions include Shane Campbell, Chicago; Museum of Modern Art Library, New York; Foxy Production, New York and David Zwirner, New York. Tyson will curate an alumni group exhibition with his brother Scott Reeder at the Art Institute of Chicago where he also teaches. In the fall of 2016 he will have a solo at The Green Gallery in Milwaukee.
