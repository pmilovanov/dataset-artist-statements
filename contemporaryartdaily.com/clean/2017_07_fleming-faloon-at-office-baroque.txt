For the first time since its move to Brussels, Office Baroque will stage an exhibition that runs simultaneously at our downtown and midtown gallery spaces on Bloemenhofplein 5 Place du Jardin aux Fleurs and Ravensteinstraat 44 Rue Ravenstein. The exhibition Fleming Faloon takes its title from the 1963-64 film by Owen Land and is entirely devoted to portraits. In Land’s film, the image of a staring TV presenter is subjected to a series of manipulations, questioning the optical ambiguity of cinema and the projected image and its resistance to time. This first 16mm film by Land was a source of inspiration for Andy Warhol’s Screen Tests. The exhibition will feature work by twenty seven artists.
