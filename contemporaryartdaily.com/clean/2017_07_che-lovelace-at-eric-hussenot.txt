The gallery is proud to introduce Che Lovelace for his first exhibition in France. Born in Trinidad, his subject, rendered in vivid pigment on board, is informed by the cultural environment of Trinidad and Tobago and by extension the Caribbean. Lovelace combines several boards assembled to produce a stable and inexpensive though archival substrate he could easily source there on the island. He incorporates this material and its format into his working process, considering the dividing edges of the panels as a way to rethink the composition of space and break up the expected sequence by which he constructed the image.
Reviewing his recent exhibition in New York, the New Yorker Magazine writes, ”Poised on the border between Cubism and realism, Lovelace doesn’t really belong to any school; part of the beauty of his work lies in watching the artist establish his own rich vocabulary. He’s not afraid of pleasure and knows how much the soul craves color—a refuge during these dark days…”
The nature of the Caribbean space is complex and offers a mystical, sexual and ultimately spiritual energy that is potent. This energy has been harnessed by many artists to make their own poetry as they respond to the place.
Che Lovelace is a visual artist living and working in Port of Spain, Trinidad. He received his training at l’Ecole Régionale des Beaux-Arts de la Martinique. He is a founder and director of CLAY J’ouvert, a traditional Carnival outfit based in Woodbrook, Port of Spain. In 2003, he co-founded the alternative cinema space Studiofilmclub with fellow artist Peter Doig and is currently a lecturer at the University of the West Indies Creative Arts Campus. His practice increasingly includes elements of performance which he absorbs into his painting process.
