Cerith Wyn Evans’ conceptual practice incorporates a wide range of media, often exploring the relation between light and text, between thought and meaning; often constructing situations conscious of a viewers’ presence. Wyn Evans’ early works employed film and video, often creating ‘expanded cinema’ environments frequently collaborating with performers. Since the 1990s his work has explored the relationship between language and space, temporality and a critique of the ‘phenomenology of perception’ characterized by a formal precision and clarity often developed in relation to the context of a particular exhibition site. Chains of references to texts, scores and gestures are evoked and interwoven in a ‘mise en scene’. Situations are ‘staged’ occasions are composed.
For Wyn Evans, installations work as a catalyst: a reservoir of potential meanings that unravel in multiple discursive journeys. Moreover; his work has a highly refined aesthetic that is informed by his abiding interest in architecture and music, by fields as seemingly disparate as fountain design and traditional Japanese theater, translation, astronomy, psychoanalysis and Morse code Objects and experiences are juxtaposed – and arranged ‘in concert’ inviting reflection and interrogation. Exhibitions are calculated to occupy and promote the potential of an encounter “to occasion reverie”.
