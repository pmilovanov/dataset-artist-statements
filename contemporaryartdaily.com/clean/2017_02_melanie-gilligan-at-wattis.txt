The system is broken. The system is rigged. Statements like these are familiar to a politically polarized American public, but rarely does political rhetoric go beyond the sound bite. The celebrity dimension of politics distracts from a detailed understanding of the economic forces that shape our lives. But Melanie Gilligan pays close attention to those forces.
Through complex installations of her low-budget films, Gilligan offers reflections on life in late capitalism. Blurring the distinctions among episodic television, documentary film, gallery exhibition, and theater, she presents perceptive assessments of the political conditions of our time.
Melanie Gilligan (b. 1979, Toronto, Canada) lives and works between New York and London. She is the 2016 Capp Street artist in residence.
This exhibition is curated by Leila Grothe.
