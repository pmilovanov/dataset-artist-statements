The works of Ida Ekblad oscillate between an unrestrained imagination and her familiarity with, and allusions to, an art-historical tradition. Her paintings of the past five years, in particular, are courageous demonstrations of the relevance and feasibility of an expressive artistic gesture. But Ekblad does not necessarily repeat expression as an authentic and essentialist format.
Ekblad works in a variety of media—painting, sculpture, installation, performance, and poetry—simultaneously and without hierarchical distinction. Among her sources of inspiration are movements in art history such as Situationism and Abstract Expressionism as well as the artists’ group CoBrA and forms of expression in contemporary pop and subculture, including in the non-visual domains of literature and music. After a phase during which her work evinced a conceptual orientation, she now devotes renewed attention to the painterly and poetic sides of her art.
For this exhibition, Ekblad has used the Museum as her studio, producing more than 30 works in situ. These new works improvise a performative architecture out of industrial debris, found objects, shopping carts and paintings.
