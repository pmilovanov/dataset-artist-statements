Throughout her three-deade career, Ericka Beckmans playful yet formally demanding films have challenged traditional esthetics and cultural narration codes. Superimposing a fairy tales lexicon on the structures and codes of traditional games, her work is a sharp criticism of the rites of learning in Western societies. In parallel with exhibition of her recent work at 1m3, LUFF hosts a retrospective of her 8mm and 16mm films. Beckmans work has been shown among others at the Museum of Modern Art, the Smithsonians Hirshhorn Museum, and the Walker Art Center, Minneapolis.
