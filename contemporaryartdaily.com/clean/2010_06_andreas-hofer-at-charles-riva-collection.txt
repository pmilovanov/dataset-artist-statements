In his work, Andreas Hofer creates complex visual worlds based on narrative structures. His thematic and formal references defy any categorisation. His vocabulary ranges from Christian, satanist, astrological or mythological symbolism to recollections from art history He juxtaposes figures from the fifties, pop culture and comic strip with icons of modernism or science-fictions, and confronts elements of horror from western mass media with the disgraced, banned stylistic features that marked the art of the Third Reich.
Using those subject matters, Hofer extracts these signs from a forbidden world, producing artworks that traverse time to become an incisive reflexion and fanciful meditation on history and popular culture.
Signing his works with the alter ego Andy Hope, and the date 1930, Hofer simultaneously invokes Andy Warhol and a dark era of European history.
