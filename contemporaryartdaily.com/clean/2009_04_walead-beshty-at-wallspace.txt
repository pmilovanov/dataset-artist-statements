With both a sharp and laconic aesthetic sensibility
Beshty creates a photography of uncertainty
Cutting across several media, including photograms
a representative example of the range of Beshty’s program
Clever if somewhat vague referents
presented as a subtly posed but effective arguments
Beshty inserts himself into the historical flow
But beware of the theoretical undertow
Photographs are created with very clear prescriptions
read as luminous abstract compositions
But have a roughed up texture that says all you need to know
One can make much, perhaps too much, of Walead Beshty’s show
Beshty has included within the exhibition
an assistant who toils like an art-world Rumpelstiltskin
This piece by Walead Beshty is briefly amusing
An accident that suggested the idea of deliberately using
A revised concept of site specificity, now proposed as a function
Investigating systems of dispersal and production
Whatever Marxist schadenfreude might be gleaned from black-and-white
Effectively reclaims the found object as a multivalent political site
Of the show’s relaxed attitude toward lines of demarcation
which, sexy as it sounded, felt like little more than rhetorical lubrication
Among the most special is Walead Beshty’s photo-slide meditation
Here flashy surface need not come at the cost of art historical, conceptual, and socio-political elaboration.
