The Belgian artists Jos de Gruyter (*1965 in Geel, lives in Brussels) und Harald Thys (*1966 in Wilrijk, lives in Brussels) celebrate slowness and the absurd in their videos and photographs. Their compellingly atmospheric video installations are characterized by an extreme elongation of time, very simple settings and the targeted use of digital effects and sound. States of being locked into pointless actions and impersonal, sometimes threatening environments and situations become allegories of the failure of communication and community. But laughter is also provoked, which finally interrupts the stasis.
After their participation in the 5th berlin biennale, Art Unlimited in Basel and solo exhibitions at the Kunsthalle Basel and the Culturgest in Lisbon, the kestnergesellschaft pays tribute to the work of Jos de Gruyter and Harald Thys with their first institutional solo exhibition in Germany, which is taking place in collaboration with the Neuer Aachener Kunstverein.
