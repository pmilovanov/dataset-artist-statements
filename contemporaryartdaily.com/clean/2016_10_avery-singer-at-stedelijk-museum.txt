The Stedelijk Museum presents the first European museum solo exhibition of the American artist Avery Singer (b. New York, NY, 1987) and her very first presentation in the Netherlands. The show will offer a comprehensive view of the artist’s work since 2012. In the IMC Gallery on the first floor, Singer will exhibit the vast installation that was enthusiastically received during her Statements presentation at Art Basel in 2015, and which has since been added to the Stedelijk’s permanent collection. Also included are several recent works realized specifically for the Stedelijk.
