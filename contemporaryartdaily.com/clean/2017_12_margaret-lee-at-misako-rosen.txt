This isn’t what I expected or what I wanted. What comes after XXX and ♡ when forward becomes reverse and stalling preferable to both? There might be some or a lot of waiting involved before I figure out where to put my flow. Trying to be more accepting of the situation but there is a banana in my tailpipe, do you know how that feels?
