Why these and not those? Very well then – they are in my Head and my Emotions
potentially for a longer or shorter period of time maybe through their Profile – from which something rebounded
– and redirected through me?
If it should’t be a tactical tick-tock then:
there are long lasting friendships / or a character, like the „Schrippenkönig von Berlin“ (Schrippen are bread buns in the Berlin dialect), who sat in a tree and ate Schrippen – while he even more stereotypical than me: always drew the same smutty remarks in crayon, („Buntstift Schweineigelein“)
Memories – misjudgements – maybe along the lines of: Black image = dark space = lights off!
or simply:
„if something is to long – make it longer“ – this Eero Saarinen quote was also not the worst
Thomas Bayrle, 2011
