Aftercare is a group exhibition bringing together nine international artists working within the topics of contemporary ways of living and consumerism standard. Inspired by model homes, Aftercare aims to emulate an idealized domestic interior. Standing beside IKEA standardized life style and manufactured zen attitude, selected works re-enact the envi- ronment of a living quarter, stimulating tensions between the livable and non-livable. An habitacle for a XXIe century assisted suicide.
