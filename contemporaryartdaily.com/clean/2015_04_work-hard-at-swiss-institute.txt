Work Hard, the graffiti message enhancing this Lausanne public sculpture from 1945 by Pierre Blanc is the title of Swiss Institute’s latest exhibition and curatorial debut of celebrated artist Valentin Carron. Carron, who represented Switzerland at the 2013 Venice Biennale, selects an exceptional range of seminal artworks combining his key homegrown influences and inspiring contemporaries.
In a display of idiosyncratic experience, this exhibition presents a creative discourse between artworks through Carron’s perspective, revealing shared concerns and principles of his native country’s art. His focus on the poetics of vernacular invokes a quirky Swiss-ness while conjuring mythologies of labor. Furthermore, this exhibition sheds light on the aesthetic universe of Carron, providing foundations for his visual and conceptual vocabulary and allowing insight into a practice that combines strategies of appropriation with sculptural bravado.
Through an individual lens, Work Hard suggests an imaginary time and place in art history as past, present and future converge in a narrative of national identity and art production.
