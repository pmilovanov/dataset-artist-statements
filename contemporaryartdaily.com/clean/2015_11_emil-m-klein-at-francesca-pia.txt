Galerie Francesca Pia is proud to present the second solo show by Emil Klein at the gallery. The show consists of seven recent oil paintings.
These works pick up a process already developed in Klein’s recent series of abstract paintings. Former works often set a starting point for new compositions, in which the form and style are adapted and changed. The time spent on each single painting increases. This temporality results in a repetitive gesture that leads to a new fabrication process; over days and weeks the slowed down speed of work lets a painting go through different states and forms. For this series, Klein decided in favor of a dark background which he covers with a white tone, leaving out lines. Some lines get painted over and over again, others get covered back over with white.
The works were all executed in the artist’s studio in Lausanne, and later in his new studio in Zurich, during 2014 and 2015.
