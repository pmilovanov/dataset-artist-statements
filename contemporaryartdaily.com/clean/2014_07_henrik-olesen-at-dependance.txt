Ms Cayenne Pepper continues to colonize all my cells â€“ a sure case of what the biologist Lynn Margulis calls symbiogenesis. I bet if you checked our DNA, youd find some potent transfections between us. Her saliva must have the viral vectors. Surely, her darter-tongue kisses have been irresistible. Even though we share placement in the phylum of vertebrates, we inhabit not just different genera and divergent families, but altogether different orders.
How would we sort things out ? Canid, homind; pet, professor; bitch, woman; animal, human; athlete, bandler. One of us has a microchip injected under her neck skin for identification;
We have had forbidden conversation; we have had oral intercourse; we are bound in telling story upon story with nothing but the facts. We are training each other in acts of communication we barely understand. We, constitutively, companion species. We make each other up, in the flesh. Significantly other to each other, in specific difference, we signify in the flash a nasty developmental infection called love. This love is an historical aberration and a naturalcultural legacy.
