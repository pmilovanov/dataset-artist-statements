We are pleased to announce “Summer through Winter” Yui Yaegashi’s third solo exhibition with the gallery. Yaegashi’s recent solo and group exhibitions include : Shane Campbell Gallery, Chicago (2017), The Modern Institute, Glasgow (2017),Parrasch Heijnen Gallery, Los Angeles (2016), Alpha M, Tokyo (2016) and Midway Contemporary, Minneapolis (2015). In 2017,Yaegashi curated “By the lakeside” for Shane Campbell Gallery.
The soundless stillness that spills from Yaegashi’s intimate abstractions has nothing to do with the silent authority of solemn situations or sacred spaces. It has, on the contrary, everything to do with those fleeting moments when you see something beautiful and your breath catches ― not so long that you get lightheaded, but just long enough to notice that you are in the presence of something special.
In his Los Angeles Times review of Yaegashis 2016 solo exhibition, art critic David Pagel concisely expressed the specific quality of her work.
