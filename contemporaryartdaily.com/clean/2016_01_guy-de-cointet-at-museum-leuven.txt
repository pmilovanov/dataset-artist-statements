Guy de Cointet (1934-1983) conceives of art as an interplay of colour, language and form. His fascination for language and meaning are expressed in his drawings, books and performances. Fragments of text, colourful objects and props blend the everyday with the absurd. His artworks come to life in performances.
A native of France, De Cointet moved to New York in 1965 and discovered pop art there. He later worked in Los Angeles, where he collaborated with Mike Kelley and Paul McCarthy, among others.
M is presenting the first retrospective exhibition of his visual work in Belgium. The exhibition consists of a selection of drawings, sculptures, sketchbooks and documentary materials. Furthermore, his live performance ‘Comme il est blonde!’ (1982) will be performed at the Playground Festival in November.
