Maureen Paley is pleased to announce a solo show at the gallery by Olivia Plender. The exhibition addresses the subject of national identity, global finance and protest movements. Architectural models, posters, drawings and costumes will be included that are informed by Plender’s interest in the 1924 British Empire Exhibition, the Suffragettes, the Women’s Social and Political Union and the Kibbo Kift Kindred. Plender’s research based practice questions the ideological framework around the narration of history. Her recent projects have explored the means by which alternative systems of knowledge production are proposed by fringe social and religious movements. Drawing on social history, Plender questions how official historical narratives are constructed, and the hierarchies behind the ‘voice of authority’ that is traditionally produced by institutions in the public sphere, such as the museum, the academy and the media.
In 2014 Plender curated an exhibition of Sylvia Pankhurst’s art works at Tate Britain, London (with The Emily Davison Lodge).
