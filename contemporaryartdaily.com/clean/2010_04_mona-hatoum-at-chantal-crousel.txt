Chantal Crousel Gallery is pleased to announce the exhibition of recent works by Mona Hatoum.
Many visitors may recall the splendid integration of Mona Hatoum’s works in two very different, historically and privately marked environments : at Darat al Funun (the Khalid Shoman Foundation) in Amman, Jordan, 2008 and at Palazzo Querini Stampalia, Venice, in 2009.
The same works presently shown in the neutral, white gallery space in Paris allow yet another reading. Indeed, a number of intimate or domestic elements, integrating furniture, hair, knicknacks, drawings, medal, dialogue with objects usually found in the public (outdoor) space: city-maps, canon balls and barbed wire. These powerful and efficient confrontations take place in an apparently playful contrast to skillfully diverted materials and altered scales. They all have in common the ever present consciousness of the fragility and the preciousness of life.
As in the past, Mona Hatoum’s work transmits the essence of awareness, unsettledness, beauty and strength.
