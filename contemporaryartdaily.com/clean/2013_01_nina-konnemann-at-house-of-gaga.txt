In her first solo exhibition in the gallery Nina Könnemann presents a video about smokers, a video for smokers and a spittoon.
Bann (7min30, HD, 2012) was filmed in London´s financial district where the spaces in which smoking is possible is increasingly restricted. The video presents a catalogue of inlets and corners where this activity is still practiced. Stains and residues, a hand or the tip of a shoe behind a wall indicate those niches.
The poster accompanying the video transports the image of smoking into a bluish fantasy world. From November 6th to November 19th the posters can be seen on commercial billboards around the gallery.
Stroom (3 min loop, HD, 2012) is a video to be shown in a designated smoking room. It was installed a month ago for the first time at Sals Café in Antwerp, Belgium. In front of the smoking room´s six standing places, the video functioned as an artificial window, an otherwise missing place upon which to rest one’s gaze. At Gaga, the video will be installed in a booth whose dimensions resemble those of the smoking chamber.
The spittoons standing next to the entrance to the gallery and the restroom door are a collaboration between the artist and Jay Chung.
