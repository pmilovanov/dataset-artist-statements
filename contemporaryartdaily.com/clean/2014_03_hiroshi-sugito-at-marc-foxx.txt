MARC FOXX is pleased to present, in his eighth solo exhibition with the gallery, new paintings by Hiroshi Sugito.
The Nagoya-based artist has received international recognition for his mysterious, ambient paintings which incorporate Western techniques and approaches in combination with his classical Japanese Nihonga training. The extraordinary fields in these paintings are the result of the artist’s practice of building layers over time. The five largest paintings in the main gallery were begun approximately ten years ago and have been in progress over that time. Present in several paintings is the artist’s signature abstracted proscenium stage composition, here with horizon lines only inches from the painting’s bottom edge, providing for a sense of a deep expanse. Enigmatic forms in some works could be read as “boat like,” and for the artist, relay both visual and conceptual balance.
Hiroshi Sugito has mounted fifty solo exhibitions and exhibited widely over the course of his career. He has three upcoming museum exhibitions in Japan over the next two years which include: Toyota Museum, Toyota, Japan (2016); Miyagi Museum, Miyagi, Japan (2015); and Clematis No Oka, Shizuoka, Japan (2015).
