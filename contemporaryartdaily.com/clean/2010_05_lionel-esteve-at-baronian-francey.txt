For the third time, the Baronian_Francey gallery is the playground of an exhibition by Lionel Estève.
Balls endlessly bouncing around. A hula hoop floating in the air. Mobiles apparently doing limbering up exercices. A black shimmering monochrome vibrating like a wave. A skipping rope circling around the place… These sculptures are all in motion and give a dynamic to the space. They remind us of the absurdity of a gym. The viewer will naturally spend time contemplating each sculpture like a playful and hypnotic little show. The artist used the now well-established vocabulary of minimal art; he used it and diverted it: the matter here is not killing the father, but playing with him.
Lionel Estève was born in Lyon in 1967. He has lived and worked in Brussels since 1990. He first exhibited his work at Baronian_Francey in 1999. His work is also exhibited at the Emmanuel Perrotin gallery in Paris and Miami and at the Bernier/Eliades gallery in Athens. He was part of the migrateur show at the Musée dart moderne de la ville de Paris, and of Generation Z at P.S.1 in New York. Three of his sculptures are currently on display at the Grand Hornu Museum in Mons. Starting in June 2010, he will have a solo show at the Domaine de Kerguéhennec, in France.
