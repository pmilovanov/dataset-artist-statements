Since 2008 Japanese artist Yuki Okumura, currently in residency at WIELS, has conducted a series of unusual workshops: he invites children from 4 to 7 years old to depict the world inside their own body and create life-sized self-portraits visualized through their imagination and interpretation.
These workshops have been organized at art museums and kindergartens in Japan and abroad, such as Aomori Contemporary Art Centre (2010), Hiroshima City Museum of Contemporary Art (2012), Anatomical Museum of the University of Basel (2012), and Zentrum Paul Klee, Bern (2013).
Yuki Okumura gave 2 workshops at WIELS on Sunday May 16. The results are on view at WIELS from June 21 until July 7 2013.
