Precisely one year past at the 55th Venice Biennial
As part of the joint Cypriot-Lithuanian pavilion
Which was titled big-O little-o, and equally little-o big-O,
Depending on your point of view (depending on your point of view)
We were asked to participate ‘as honorary Lithuanians’
By Raimundas Malašauskas, who assembled the whole show
In the Brutalist Palasport—a monumental sports hall with
A central court for basketball flanked by rows of concrete bleachers.
Our idea was then to hijack the court’s two opposing scoreboards
And turn them into dual clocks (though you’d never see both at once).
These clocks would count time not by means of normal decimal numbers,
But using big-Os and small-os, that binary character set.
We sent along instructions to the scoreboard’s manufacturer
To burn a microchip that would alter its usual function
And reprogram the system to display this maladjusted time,
Then christened it Work-in-Progress — in order to be continued
