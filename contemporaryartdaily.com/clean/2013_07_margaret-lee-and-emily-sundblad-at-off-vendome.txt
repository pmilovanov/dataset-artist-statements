Wearing your stripes on the outside requires only a simple affection for color and form. Hardy cottons with painterly graphic touches are draped on a menagerie that includes a zebra, a giraffe and a pair of leopards. What distinguishes one animal from another, beyond its particular color palette, is the drape. Ranging from the casual slouch, rigid formality to voluminous, lush layering, the fabrics reshape the everyday objects underneath. The gesture of the hand unifies the lot as hand painted dots, spots, stripes, circles and other geometric forms commingle with raw brush work, giving these artworks life and intelligence. The colors are simple, graphic and rich: umber, white, black, yellow and Pyrrolean red. The handmade tassels seen on the two leopards are made by Düsseldorf’s own Franz Schubert who was born into a long-established Cologne Posamentiersfamilie and now runs Borrmans posamente on Mindene Strasse 29, located 10 minutes away from the gallery. Dont forget to go downstairs and follow the arrow.
