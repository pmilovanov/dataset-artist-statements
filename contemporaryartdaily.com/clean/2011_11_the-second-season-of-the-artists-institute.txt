The second season, we thought about the artist Jo Baer, and showed a rotating selection of her works. This led us to also presenting some paintings by Silke Otto-Knapp; a lecture by Jan Verwoert; an installation by Ei Arakawa and Nik Gambaroff; a one-day orchid sale; works and a performance by Anne-Mie van Kerckhoven; a conversation between Lynne Cooke, Katy Siegel, and David Reed; films by Richard Serra, Morgan Fisher, and Anthony McCall; and recorded lectures by Michel Foucault. This all took place between January and July 2011. Thank you.
