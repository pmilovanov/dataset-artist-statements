Matthew Marks is pleased to announce an exhibition of new work by Robert Gober, the next exhibition in his galleries at 1062 North Orange Grove and 7818 Santa Monica Boulevard. Robert Gober: Sculpture Drawings Studies will be the artistâ€™s first one-person exhibition of new work in four years, and his first one-person show in Los Angeles in fifteen years.
Gober has produced three large sculptures, several smaller sculptures, and a group of works on paper for this exhibition. All of them will be exhibited here for the first time. A selection of related earlier works will also be included.
