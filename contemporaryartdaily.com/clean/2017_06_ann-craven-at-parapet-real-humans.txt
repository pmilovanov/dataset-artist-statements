Parapet Real Humans is delighted to announce the first solo exhibition in Saint Louis by New York based painter ANN CRAVEN.
For her exhibition, Craven presents four paintings: a portrait, a bird, a stripe and a palette. Seeing no differentiation from the four canvases and by treating them as the same entity, she takes the hierarchy out of “subject” and places more emphasis on the unbridled process of “form”. Neutralizing the subject through continual variations and repetitions, she removes any sense of preciousness in the work shifting the conversation about her work into a theoretical frame that considers the body as a whole, rather than its individual parts. By reworking, re-presenting and returning to the same stock subject matter, Craven engages questions of authenticity, collection, consumption and skill, thus examining the durability of a painted icon in a world that consumes mass imagery at record speeds.
Ann Craven (b.1967, Boston) lives and works in New York. In addition to numerous group exhibitions, Ann Craven’s major solo exhibitions include her current show: Animals 1999- 2017 at Southard Reid, London; Hello, Hello, Hello at Maccarone, NYC in 2015; I like Blue at Gallery DIET, Miami in 2015; and Ann Craven at Hannah Hoffman Gallery, Los Angeles in 2014. She has three Artist Monologues of her work including Ann Craven: TIME (Le Confort Moderne, Poitiers France); Ann Craven: Shadows Moon and Abstract Lies (JRP Ringier and FRAC Champagne Ardenne); Ann Craven: Pensée, (Karma Books and Maccarone) .
