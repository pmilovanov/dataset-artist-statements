Jan Mot is proud to announce a solo show of Francis Alÿs entitled Without an Ending There is no Beginning, which will take place from March 17th to April 22nd. It is Alÿs’s first solo show in a Belgian gallery and simultaneously the inaugural exhibition in our new space at Petit Sablon / Kleine Zavel 10 in Brussels.
The Belgian-born Francis Alÿs, who is internationally renowned for his multifaceted artistic practice addressing urgent political, social and economic issues in poetic and imaginative ways, will present a new version of Lada Kopeika Project, his work for Manifesta 10 (2014) in St. Petersburg.
“When we were young, my brother and I shared a 1981 Lada Riva. One day we decided to escape our bourgeois Belgian city and drive to Leningrad. But the car broke down and soon after our lives parted. 30 years later I invite my brother to drive from Belgium to St. Petersburg, now in a 1977 Lada Kopeika. Upon arrival we’ll crash the car into a tree in the courtyard of the Winter Palace, together with the illusions of our youth. Without and ending there is no beginning.” (F.A.)
