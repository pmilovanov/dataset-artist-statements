In our second solo exhibition of the work of French painter Martin Barré (1924-1993), we present documentation of three of the artist’s Photo-Conceptual projects from the years 1969 and 1970. Two of these exhibition projects, the so-called Objets déchrochés (Misplaced Objects) and Calendrier (Calendar) were shown at the Galerie Daniel Templon space in Paris in 1969 and 1970. A third project, Verticales (Verticals), was Martin Barré’s contribution to the exhibition “Umwelt-Akzente. Die Expansion der Kunst (Environmental Accents – the Expansion of Art)”, organized by Klaus Honnef in 1970 for the Monschau Kunstkreis.
To contextualize these projects within the work of Martin Barré, an artist who saw himself exclusively as a painter, we show three paintings, each from a group of work that was produced by the artist directly before and after these specific Photo-Conceptual projects.
A comprehensive text on the work of Martin Barré in the monograph Martin Barré by Yve-Alain Bois, published in 1993 by Yve-Alain Bois and Groupe Flammarion in Paris, was printed in English for the first time in the catalogue Martin Barré, published in 2008 by Thea Westreich and Ethan Wagner in collaboration with Galerie Buchholz in Berlin/Cologne, Andrew Kreps Gallery in New York and Galerie Obadia in Paris.
We would like to thank Michèle Barré, Paul Galvez and Yve-Alain Bois for their collaboration on this exhibition.
