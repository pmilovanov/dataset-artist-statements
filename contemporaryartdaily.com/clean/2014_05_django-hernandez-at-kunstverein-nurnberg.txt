The Kunstverein Nürnberg Albrecht Dürer Gesellschaft is pleased to present a comprehensive solo exhibition by Diango Hernández (b. 1970, Sancti Spìritus, Cuba; lives in Düsseldorf, Germany).
Entitled In hazard, translated, Diango Hernández exhibition unfolds a series of narrative fragments and sculptural assemblages concerning a multifaceted reading of history. Based on an incisive historical event – a hurricane that devastated the southeast coast of Cuba in 1932, he develops own visual translations in order to take a differentiated view of the present. As a result, a nonlinear and ambivalent narrative evolves that poses questions of the individual’s capacity to act when faced with precarious and ineluctable situations. Hernández’s works not only follow traces and memories, but also explore the potential of their translation to indicate inherent future developments and visions.
