Pilar Corrias is pleased to present the first solo exhibition at the gallery by the American artist Rachel Rose.

Lake Valley (2016), is a cel animated video set in an imagined suburb. Each frame is a composite of elements from 19th-20th century children’s book illustrations cut, layered, and re-mapped for the present-day.
The suburban places encountered in the video—the house, the parking lot, the park—are familiar and not. There is simultaneity of past and present in all surfaces of the video—a plastic garbage bag is an illustration of a woman’s hair; an egg shell is an amalgam of dragon skin, cobble stones, and beer.
The story of Lake Valley follows an imagined pet as it seeks attention on one particularly lonely day. The pet leaves its family in search of connection in the nearby green. The narrative is rooted in the theme of abandonment that permeates childhood in children’s literature. Abandonment, like a suburban house, is relatively ordinary experience sustained by everyday routines and anxieties.
