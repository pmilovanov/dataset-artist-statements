NEW YORK The Paula Cooper Gallery is pleased to present Every Revolution is a Roll of the Dice, a group exhibition organized by Bob Nickas, his fourth for the gallery. The exhibition will be on view from January 8 through February 7, 2009 at 534 West 21st Street.
A stage has been set:
Figures of dissolution, damage, and death.
Vehicles and structures destroyed.
Violence in slow motion.
The desert remains
firmly in place.
The happy ending comes at the beginning
so as not to spoil the surprise.
Every Revolution
is a Roll of the Dice
The artists in the exhibition include: Barry X Ball, Huma Bhabha, Carol Bove, Trisha Donnelly, Gardar Eide Einarsson, Jason Fox, Wayne Gonzales, Robert Grosvenor, Louise Lawler, John Miller, Kelley Walker, and Joan Wallace.
The title of the exhibition is taken from the 1978 film by Jean-Marie Straub and Danielle Huillet, based on the poem by Stéphane Mallarmé, Un coup de dés jamais nabolira le hasard (A roll of the dice will never abolish chance). The movie was filmed near the graves of the Communards of 1871, who were executed and buried at Père Lachaise cemetery in Paris. The Franco-Prussian war had been lost; defeated, embattled, and disgraced, the government of France turned on its own citizens and crushed the uprising.
