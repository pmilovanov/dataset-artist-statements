Museo Tamayo will present the first monographic exhibition of Cerith Wyn Evans in México, which will gather twelve pieces produced in the last ten years. From neon sculptures, kinetic and organic elements, sound pieces, and a series of Murano glass candlesticks, the exhibition seeks to trigger sensitive and temporary experiences in the viewer. Together, these elements will create an immersive environment to challenge the ideas of perception, cognition, subjectivity, and reality.
Wyn Evans’ artistic practice examines the communication possibilities of ideas through shape. His work in installation, sculpture, photography, and text, among other media, with a highly sophisticated aesthetic, is influenced by cinema, music, literature, and philosophy, form where he takes sources and visual or textual ideas that are often repeated in his artworks. Additionally, he tries to break down the existing communication systems by subverting the shapes of some materials or by alternating the space-time coordinates.
