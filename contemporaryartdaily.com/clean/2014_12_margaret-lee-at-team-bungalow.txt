Team (gallery, inc.) is pleased to announce a solo show of work by New York-based artist Margaret Lee. Entitled Reading Into Things, the exhibition will run from 16 November 2014 through 25 January 2015. Team (bungalow) in located at 306 Windward Avenue in Venice, CA. Concurrently, our 47 Wooster Street and 83 Grand Street spaces in New York will house exhibitions by Andreas Schulze and Sam Samore, respectively.
Decontextualization serves as the fulcrum of Margaret Lee’s practice. Frequently pairing readymades with alternately fabricated and hand-crafted objects, the work consistently interrogates modes of display, transforming the act of presentation into a subject unto itself. The works employ their context to generate meaning; as artifice supplants substance, questions of content are rendered irrelevant.
Lee’s objects and materials are loaded with immediately identifiable referents, all of which can be read as metonymic or metaphorical surrogates for broader concepts like femininity, masculinity, commodity or self-reflection. However, her interest is not merely in evoking these notions, but in interrogating the act of signification, and the ways in which the viewer receives and processes symbols.





Reveling in the detritus of established good taste, Lee’s work intentionally evokes many of the common trappings of contemporary art, mimicking and appropriating the clichéd tropes relied upon by artists and their supporting institutions, transforming objects of luxury into objects of ridicule.
