This new installation by Amanda Ross-Ho encompasses architectural elements, large-scale paintings, fabricated objects, textiles, and photographs created specifically for the MOCA Pacific Design Center. AMANDA ROSS-HO: TEENY TINY WOMAN evolves her continued interest in translation, scale, and the authored collapse of authentic gesture and performance. Her work interrogates intimate territories of experience, toggling between the context of production and the context of reception, to create an infinite loop of meaning.
