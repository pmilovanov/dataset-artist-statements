Apichatpong Weerasethakuls (MFA 1997, HON 2011) work reveals stories often excluded in history in and out of Thailand: voices of the poor and the ill, marginalized beings, and those silenced and censored for personal and political reasons. SAICs Sullivan Galleries will present the US premiere of Apichatpong Weerasethakul: The Serenity of Madness, curated by Gridthiya Gaweewong (MA 1996) and produced by Independent Curators International, New York. This exhibition presents a selected survey of rarely-seen experimental short films and video installations by Weerasethakul, alongside his photography, drawings, sketches, and archival material that explore threads of sociopolitical commentary. His passionate positions regarding class, labor, sexuality, science and spirituality have informed his practice from early in his career to the present. Organized with Graduate Curatorial Assistants, Katie Cato (MAAH 2018), Luna Goldberg (MAAH 2018), and Désirée Coral Guerra (MFA 2018).
