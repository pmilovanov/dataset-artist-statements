With this exhibition, Hieros Glyphos, literally sacred words we want to demonstrate that a lot of artists in the early years of this new millennium return to the aesthetics of constructivism and modernism of the 50â€™s up until minimal-art, if only from the question whether these movements reached their ultimate goal or not and if it is not possible, as Benjamin claimed, to connect and reconcile the present world with what already existed and thus to complete a more comprehensive whole, either by contextualization, either through a process of reliving.
Therefore we chose as a challenging reference a work by Ad Reinhardt that is exemplary of what is meant here with modernism. We also have four artists who have all in their idiosyncratic way affinities with the ideas of Reinhardt for whom art is not what is not art and everything else is different.
Besides Ann Veronica Janssens, there is also works by Katja Strunz, Mandla Reuter and Michael Dean.
