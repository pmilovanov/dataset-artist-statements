“A utopia minus a bottom, a place where the machines are idle, and the sun has turned to glass […]” -Robert Smithson, A Tour of the Monuments of Passaic, Artforum, October 1967.
Taka Ishii Gallery Kyoto is pleased to announce Aftermath, a group exhibition curated by Simon Castets. The exhibition is based upon the twofold definition of its title, Aftermath, and conveys the somber meaning of the word (the consequences or aftereffects of an event, esp. when unpleasant) while alluding to its auspicious second sense (new grass growing after mowing or harvest). Dwelling upon a narrative of destruction / creation, the show brings out the dramatic potency of residual elements, ex nihilo construction and renascent forms.
The exhibition will feature work by: Ceal Floyer, Aurélien Froment, Isa Genzken, Christian Holstad, Yuki Kimura, Miguel Monroy, Will Rogan, Sterling Ruby, Susanne M. Winterling
In addition to works by the aforementioned, the exhibition features excerpts from Michelangelo Antonionis Zabriskie Point (1970) and the Lumière brothers Demolition of a Wall (1896).
