Josephine Pryde’s solo presentation in the Municipal Gallery of Schwaz comprises works from the artist’s series “This Time Last Year,” analogue photographs from the series “The Eyes,” whose prints are on display here for the first time, the series “Squid,” made for the first issue of Hard Mag in 2005, and “Charisma,” Pryde’s oldest work from 1991.
Schwaz is to some a remote location, as remote as is the organ you are examining with your rubber-gloved finger.
The pictures of the series “This Time Last Year” were taken upon a late night shopping in London in autumn 2011 and presented exactly one year later in the exhibition “Night Out” at the Simon Lee Gallery on Berkeley Street, located in the very district of the late night shops. Aluminum tubes penetrate the pictures. The technical reference “photograph on aluminum” is followed by “aluminum on photograph on aluminum.”
For her series “Squid,” Josephine Pryde photographed a squid and several octopuses in various changing rooms together with shirts, jeans, and jackets. Pryde presents the pictures, which were originally tailored to a magazine format, as framed photographs on the walls of the Palais Enzenberg.
“Charisma“ from 1991 relies on the contrast between “poor” materials and the word “charisma,” a quality attributed to special people, and relates to the First Gulf War with its year of production.
The bridge connecting the works is time. In some ways, “Mrs. Prude to Dr. Hole and Mrs. SXXXX to Dr. Serious” may be seen as the most retrospective exhibition of the three shows which Josephine Pryde has presented in the Kunstverein für die Rheinlande und Westfalen, Düsseldorf, the Kunsthalle Bern, and the Municipal Gallery of Schwaz since February 2012.
