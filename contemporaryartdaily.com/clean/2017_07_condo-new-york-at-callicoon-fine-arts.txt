The inaugural Condo New York, a collaborative exhibition by 36 galleries across 16 New York spaces, will take place from June 29 â€“ July 29, 2017. In 2016, Vanessa Carlos (Carlos/Ishikawa) founded Condo London as a way to offer international galleries a site for creative collaboration and exchange.
New York galleries will host a visiting gallery (or galleries) by either co-curating an exhibition together or dividing the host gallery into different exhibition spaces. Condo arose from a reevaluation of existing exhibition models, a desire to pool resources and act communally, and the need to activate the gallery space in a different manner. Through this partnership, Condo offers a more generous and encouraging environment for the global presentation of experimental exhibitions.
