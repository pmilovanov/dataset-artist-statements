Matthew Marks is pleased to announce, Terry Winters: Cricket Music, Tessellation Figures, &amp; Notebook, the next exhibition in his gallery at 522 West 22nd Street.
The exhibition consists of 11 large-scale vibrantly colored recent paintings. Winters depicts forms inspired by mathematical concepts like tessellations and knot theory, as well as shapes from the natural and scientific worlds in these new canvases. His kaleidoscopic compositions of overlapping grids and patterns create complex pictorial spaces, and his use of transparent pigments allows the viewer to see, as the artist has said, “all the events that went into the making of the painting.” The title Tessellation Figures refers to the process of creating a two-dimensional plane through the repetition of a geometric shape.
Notebook, 2003-2011, will be on view in the gallery at 502 West 22nd Street for the first time in this country. These striking collages of found images layered on top of one another reveal the lasting tension between abstraction and representation in Winters’ work and are the source for many of his images in recent years.
Terry Winters (born 1949) lives and works in New York City and Columbia County, New York. He has had solo exhibitions at Tate Gallery, London (1986); the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York (1992); Whitechapel Art Gallery, London (1998); the Kunsthalle Basel (2000); The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York (2001); and the Irish Museum of Modern Art, Dublin (2009).
