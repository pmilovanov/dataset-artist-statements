The exhibition is conceived as a tribute to Frank Stella’s late 1970s series of paintings “Indian Birds,” and in particular to Khar Pidda (1978), published on the cover of Flash Art International 92-93 in 1979. Compared to Stella’s previous series, the “Indian Birds” display a more complex, grand and baroque, composition, where the containing background is suppressed in favor of a merely structural metal grid. Large irregular panels overlap in a layered entanglement of curves—making the visual assimilation of the paintings as an “endeavor,” an attempt to solve the dialectics between the many parts constituting the ensemble, and leveling the mobility of the pictorial space.
The exhibition will bring together contemporary artworks which could be visually related to “fragments” of the “Indian Birds”, in order to inquire Stella’s shifting compositional process, visual references and sculptural approach to painting. Echoing the approach of the French group Supports/Surfaces, the exhibition display will play with the deconstruction, dismantling and subverting of Khar Pidda.
