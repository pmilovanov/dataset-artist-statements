Tomma Abts’s paintings and drawings are created through a rigorous working process that combines the rational with the intuitive. Starting with no external source material and no preconceived idea of the final result, Abts’s complex abstract compositions ultimately take as their subject the process of their own creation. Abts’s AAM exhibition is the first to survey the artist’s drawing practice, including new works created specifically for the exhibition. Winner of the prestigious 2006 Turner Prize awarded by Tate Britain, Abts has exhibited widely, including solo exhibitions at the Kunsthalle Basel, Switzerland; New Museum, New York; Hammer Museum, Los Angeles; and Kunsthalle Düsseldorf; among many other institutions. Tomma Abts: Mainly Drawings is accompanied by a fully illustrated catalogue.
