For more than twenty years Liam Gillick (born 1964, U. K.) has questioned the exhibition as a phenomenon and isolated possible markers that could define it. These include the occupation of time, the role of the institution and varied forms of collaboration. In the 1990s the most prominent of his interests questioned the dynamic relationship between artists, curators and institutions. Twenty years later he is working with curatorial students to reanimate early works from the 1990s. The first version of this process was From 199A to 199B at the CCS Bard Hessel Museum in New York in 2012.
The exhibition From 199C to 199D is a completely new development that expands upon the original exhibition. Liam Gillick has worked closely alongside the students of the Ecole du Magasin – Claire Astier, Paola Bonino, Giulia Bortoluzzi, Neringa Bumblienė, Selma Boskailo, Anna Tomczak and MAGASIN – national contemporary art centre in Grenoble, France Director Yves Aupetitallot for nine months towards the reanimation of a selection of key works from the 1990s. Particular focus is upon works that articulate changes and continuities in cultural, political and social discourse over the last twenty years. The exhibition at Magasin expands in different way through a publication and the official website www.ecoledumagasin.com/session23
