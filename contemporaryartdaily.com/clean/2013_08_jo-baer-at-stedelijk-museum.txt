In the 1960s and 1970s, Baer, along with contemporaries such as Donald Judd and Sol LeWitt, was one of the pioneers of Minimal Art. The paintings and drawings in the exhibition illustrate Baer’s interest in the practices of our Neolithic past, with stone, astronomical alignments, skull cults, and ancestor worship as her subject matter. Baer became interested in this prehistory while living and working in a Norman castle in rural Ireland from 1975 to 1982. A recent visit to Neolithic sites inspired her to create the series of paintings for which the vast “Hurlstone” came to form both subject and object.
