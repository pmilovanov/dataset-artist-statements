Snake River Plain – In the distance, a volcano in one direction, a temple, in another direction. Anna pivots with Deflector:
Bird in my mouth
Teeth in my mouth
Head in my mouth
Heart in my mouth
Spider in my mouth
Gold in my mouth
Grill in my mouth
Words in my mouth
Bitter in my mouth
Tail in my mouth
Orchestra in my mouth
Car in my mouth
Metal in my mouth
Plastic in my mouth
Moon in my mouth
Ashes in my mouth
Beard in my mouth
Alive in my mouth
Dead in my mouth
Watch in my mouth
Time in my mouth
Closed in my mouth
Lock in my mouth
Burning in my mouth
Shell in my mouth
Monster in my mouth
Refuse in my mouth
Street in my mouth
Grass in my mouth
Hair in my mouth
Blood in my mouth
Money in my mouth
Grapes in my mouth
Stones in my mouth
Marbles in my mouth
Shit in my mouth
Blue in my mouth
Sun in my mouth
Muzzle in my mouth
2: At Helmut’s position: Noon 1, Noon 2, Noon 3 raise and lower their own heads, and then their feet to the neck.
3: At Noon at Weed Beach:
Re-positioning Anna’s sight lines
First under the head
then through the eyes
then in the door
then thru shields
then into the living area
full circles past the shadow
is it a time keeper
to the knife
to the petal
