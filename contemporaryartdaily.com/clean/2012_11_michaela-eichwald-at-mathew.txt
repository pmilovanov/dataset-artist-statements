Unlike many other artists (or, you could say: Against a general condition of subjectivity formation in neoliberal Germany—in which we are all financially imbricated—), Michaela Eichwald doesnt need to inhabit an escape-hatch personality shell to make herself feel real.
The heat generated by her body against this still always-present limitation, which is also her hand against the repellant support surface, which is also the inability that comes out as refusal to make a smoothness that is really relentless financial striation that is also what many people mean to do when they position themselves in a network of friends. Michaela Eichwald will not give you the breakdown you seek as you attempt to find a readily exploitable set of data points to become friends with. It is everything and it is raining and you slip and fall down the stairs.
At Mathew, Michaela Eichwald will show new paintings.
