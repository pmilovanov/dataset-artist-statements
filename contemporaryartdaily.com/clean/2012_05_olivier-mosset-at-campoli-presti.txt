Indipendenza Studio is pleased to present a solo exhibition by Olivier Mosset.
Mosset has been instrumental in raising questions about painting as an historic object. In the Sixties when he was part of the Parisian BMPT group (the acronym represents the initials of the surnames of the founding members: Daniel Buren, Olivier Mosset, Niele Toroni and Michel Parmentier) his interests were already geared towards resetting pictorial practice and its minimum conditions of existence. His canvases were covered with geometric and elementary shapes. The aim was to give maximum value to the act of painting, not as a representative tool but as an object in its own right capable of modifying the context in which painting is operating. In the course of his practice Mosset has radicalised thinking about the medium in its most purely material aspect: canvas, frame, paint, surface, format, light.
For the exhibition at Indipendenza Studio, Mosset presents a series of monochrome black and white canvases painted using a rubber polymer paint more commonly used for industrial purposes. With this series of works he continues to blur the concept of authorship working on the surface and its texture. Mossets artistic practice and his questioning of paintings status have become an influential point of reference.
Olivier Mosset was born in Bern in 1944 and lives and works in Tucson, Arizona. His work forms part of the permanent collections of MoMA, New York; the Pompidou Centre, Paris; the Migros Museum, Zurich; the Musée Cantonal des Beaux-Arts, Lausanne; the Musée des Beaux Arts, La Chaux-De-Fonds, Switzerland; and the MAC, Lyon. Kunsthalle Zurich is currently presenting a solo exhibition of the artists work.
