VW (VeneKlasen/Werner) is pleased to announce an exhibition by Jason Dodge from October 30 to December 23.
Jason Dodge’s work is born of a love for a simple economy of visual and literal language. The artist’s seemingly minimal sculptures and spatial interventions belie an intense interest in the emotional potential for objects to transmit meaning. Unexpected combinations of apparently familiar objects, presented out of place and stripped of their function or purpose, create an elusive and poetic narrative sustained by a broad network of associations. Evocative of something unseen or somewhere else, Jason Dodge’s works explore surprising histories and untold tales.
Jason Dodge commissioned handweavers from different parts of the world to weave a blanket the colour of a body of water (sea, lake or river) nearest to their loom. The blankets will be placed in the gallery in combination with organ pipes. The premise is simple: wind, water, sound, but the distance it travels is epic – from the gallery rooms to the organ maker’s work shop, from Indonesian mines to the Guatemalan weaver’s loom.
Jason Dodge’s first major exhibition in Germany, “I woke up. There was a note in my pocket that explained what had happened”, was presented at Kunstverein Hannover earlier this year and was accompanied by the artist’s first major monographic publication. Other recent exhibitions include a solo project for Kunstverein Dusseldorf; “Plus Gèneral en Particular” at Frac des Pays de la Loire; “The Quick and the Dead”, Walker Art Center, Minneapolis; and “Scorpio’s Garden”, Temporäre Kunsthalle, Berlin.
Jason Dodge’s exhibition is on view at VW (VeneKlasen/Werner) from October 30 through December 23, 2010. There will be a reception for the artist October 29 from 6 to 9 pm.
