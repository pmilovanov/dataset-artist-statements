On view in the gallery are nine stand-alone panels that bisect the room in a curvilinear configuration. Composed of polyester foam padding, bamboo sticks, batik-dyed cotton, rice glue, clear vinyl, papier-mâché, canvas and other materials, these panels collectively evoke the polarizing barrier between East and West Berlin from 1961-1989.
Its difficult to imagine a scenario of impossible exchange, now that data has become the global general equivalent. The two artists present will play the multicultural diplomat, but whose power does this serve, really? If connectivity defines the paradigm that continuously disappoints, perhaps its because we forget that a point of contact is also a point of separation. To view a wall begs the question of how you stand in relation to it. Who do you love?
1989 the number, another summer
