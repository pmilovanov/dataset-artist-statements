Francesca Pia Gallery is happy to announce the first exhibition by Tobias Madison, who has been represented by the gallery since 2013. For the exhibition, the gallerys architecture has undergone a number of changes, reflecting on an ambivalence towards the space. Neither improvements nor sabotage, they merely allow a different kind of air circulation.
Within, Madison is presenting a new body of work, all untitled, 2015. Made out of wood, polyurethane and epoxy resin they are framing or supporting structures for dried up iodine. The works present themselves as a problem: They cleanse but stain, they kill but cure, they seem like the body but are not the body. While what is being supported or framed seems to be blackened out, the works in their collective appearance are drawing out a framework for a house that perhaps ultimately only one person could live in.
Madison claims that they were not made with coherence in mind but rather and only for a certain manner of speaking, one that he sees as present when Francesca Pia herself is speaking.
On the occasion of the opening Madison will sing the song Plastic Palace People by Scott Walker from 1968, channelling the singers precarious role as an industry insider looking outside.
