Encrypted in compressions Queens and Jacks, Olympians, Rabbits, Dragons, Disciples and Principles on the edge of replication, syntactical yet absurdist, invalidating and reformatting, Reading Writing Arithmetic, Darren Bader’s first solo exhibition in Athens opens at Radio Athènes on Wednesday September the 16th.
Round Room, a collection of 15 poems by Darren Bader translated from English to Ancient Greek, Modern Greek and back into English, has been published on the occasion of the exhibition. The necessary precondition to revel in the cascades of language and dislocations of meaning more than once is bilinguality.
