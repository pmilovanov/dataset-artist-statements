Beginning in the early-2000s Jensen became well known for so-called “painting without paint,” creating abstractions using found textiles and their ancillary marks. Jensen’s spare, expansive works were said to avoid all signs of willful expression, forgoing painterly gesture for apparently received forms. This year Jensen debuted a new body of work conspicuous for seeming to break with his signature style. In his exhibition at Galerie Buchholz figures suggesting Renaissance, Romantic or proto-Modernist sources are rendered with a technique resembling the layering of tempera or fresco painting. On inspection the solemn scenes depicted hint at having been patched together from diverse materials – a Northern Renaissance head, in one example, joined to an 18th-century British torso. Jensen’s sewn abstractions invoke a tradition of “high painting,” adopting its conventions but emptying them out. In a similar way Jensen’s new work, with its faint coloration, seems to take its atmosphere and emotions from the history of representational painting, but leaves its narrative threads untied.
