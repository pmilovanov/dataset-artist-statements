Maria Loboda’s exhibition stretches across the one-thousand-square-metre hall of the CAC, assuming the structure of an ancient chant; a repetitive chant of hope during times of collapse, which, by its rhythm, extends through to the unknown.
In Vilnius, Loboda further pursues her ongoing artistic explorations into archaic concepts of diverse belief systems, transcendental ideas of the human soul and their manifestations in arcane objects, archaeology, architecture, religion and art. This quest is mapped out into the total spatial installation consisting of a system of marks, which denote experiences of transition and transformation.
Maria Loboda (b. 1979, Cracow, Poland) creates puzzling and enigmatic spaces that lead deep into layers of rich historical narratives, and refer to the current state of things. Loboda graduated from the Städelschule in Frankfurt-am-Main under the class of Mark Leckey. Her work has been presented in numerous institutions worldwide including Documenta13. Her solo exhibitions have been held at Museo Reina Sofia, Kunstverein Braunschweig, Modern Art Oxford, and The Power Plant Contemporary Art Gallery in Toronto.
