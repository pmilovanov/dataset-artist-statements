The ICA presents a solo exhibition by the American artist, writer and curator Oscar Tuazon. The artist creates sculptures and installations that are characterised by a sense of tension. Comprised of both natural and industrial materials, Tuazon’s structures reference minimalist sensibilities, DIY aesthetics and the formal language of architecture. At the ICA, Tuazon will be making a radical, site-specific intervention in the exhibition spaces. Pushing the physical boundaries of the gallery, the structure will incorporate, penetrate and infiltrate the ICA’s lower gallery and concourse.
Tuazon was born in 1975 in Seattle, Washington, USA. He grew up in the suburb of Tacoma, before leaving to study art at Cooper Union, New York. He subsequently attended the Whitney Independent Study Program, and worked under Vito Acconci at Acconci Studio. In 2007, he moved to Paris and co-founded the artist run collective and gallery, castillo/corrales. Tuazon has had numerous solo shows including at Kunsthalle Bern (2010), Parc Saint Léger Centre d’art contemporain (2010), Centre international dart et du paysage de lîle de Vassivière (2009), Künstlerhaus Stuttgart (2009), David Roberts Foundation, London (2009) and Palais de Tokyo, Paris (2007).
