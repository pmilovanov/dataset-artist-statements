With the 1975 installation Gesang der Schreitsockel, Museum of Art Lucerne was able to acquire a major work by the German artist Franz Erhard Walther from his 1992 solo exhibition in the old Kunsthaus. The 55 individual pieces that can be arranged into different-shaped tracks are matched with a 70-part series of working drawings. Together they convey sculptural ideas, possible arrangements and instructions for an actual use of the ‘walking-tracks’ presented in ‘storage form’, and represent a concept of the work that includes the visual idea of a level of action alongside the real object. The work is now being shown for the first time in the new museum spaces, and made available for discussion.
