The ICA brings together a selection of paintings by London-based poet and painter David Robilliard in the first UK institutional exhibition for over twenty years. These intimate paintings combine figurative elements with text taken directly from Robilliards own poems. Coded and knowing, his evocative prose alludes to intimate sexual encounters and passing infatuations that ultimately conjure an image of 1980s queer London. Robilliard moved to London in 1975 and would become close friends with Gilbert &amp; George, momentarily appearing in the film The World of Gilbert &amp; George (1981). Throughout the 1980s Robilliard published books and postcards of his poetry, as well as contributing to publications such as The Fred, Square Peg and The Manipulator. Robilliard was described by Gilbert &amp; George as ‘the new master of the modern person’. Robilliard’s paintings appeared in numerous gallery exhibitions during his lifetime, as well as exhibiting in venues such as Londons Hippodrome and LEscargot restaurant. In 1993, a major retrospective was held at the Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam.
