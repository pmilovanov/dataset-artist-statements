AND LIFE GOES ON I WOKE UP LIKE THIS!
LEFT BRAIN; MATHEMATICS
RIGHT BRAIN; INTUITION
LEFT BRAIN; CALCULATION
RIGHT BRAIN; FEELINGS, EMPATHY, FEELINGS OF
INADEQUACY, OF OUTSIDEDNESS, OF
FEELING OUTSIDE.
WORKERS LEAVING THE FACTORY.
THE FACT. FACT. FACTORY. INFORMATION WANTS TO
BE FREE. AND SO DO WE.
PUBLIC SPACE IS SHRINKING.
ANYONE NOT PART OF YOUR NETWORK, NOT
ON YOUR SPEED-DIAL
WILL JUST BE CONSIDERED EXTRA, LIKE IN THE WAY
SOMEHOW
TERRORISTS, RAPISTS, PEOPLE ASKING FOR MONEY.
AIR IS PIERCED BY SIGNALS, NETWORKS
FOR WI-FI, MONITORING, SURVEILLANCE.
IT USED TO BE THE VILLAGE IDIOT, BECAUSE EVERY
VILLAGE
HAD ONE, AND THEN PEOPLE WOULD TAKE TURNS IN
TAKING ‘CARE’ OF HIM OR HER.
NOW ALL THERE IS, IS PHARMACEUTICALS AND A
COLD PLACE.
THE SPACE IS DIVIDED IN TWO. ONE SIDE
IS WORKING WHILE THE OTHER ONE IS ALSO WORKING.
TRANSPORTATION AND TRANSFORMATION.
PEOPLE GOING TO MOVIES ARE NO LONGER AFRAID OF
BEING HIT BY A TRAIN. BUT MAYBE THEY SHOULD BE
IN
THE END. MAYBE THEN WE WOULD START GOING PLACES
AGAIN. / Karl Holmqvist
