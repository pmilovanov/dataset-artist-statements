Paula Cooper Gallery is pleased to present an exhibition of 19th, 20th and 21st century works that explore the tradition of artists copying the work of other artists. These “after images” operate in multiple registers as they explore methods of artistic study, suggest unexpected trajectories of historical resonance, and pose questions about appropriation and originality.The exhibition will be on view from May 2nd through June 13th at 521 West 21st Street.
