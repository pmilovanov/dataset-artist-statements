The American Jordan Wolfson, born in 1980, is often regarded as one of the most exciting artists of his generation. Presented in the framework of his solo exhibition at the Schmela Haus is a selection of new and old works which represents a welcome opportunity to become acquainted with the full range of his creative production. His work centers on an investigation of our cultural unconscious as well as our consumer culture, which he pursues via filmic, painterly, and photographic approaches.
In order to adapt this small survey to the very special setting of the Schmela Haus, Wolfson visited the building a number of times in recent months and has conceptualized a series of artistic interventions especially for this context, transforming our perceptions of the architecture and making a visit to the Schmela Haus — independently of the presentation of his works — into an enduring experience.
