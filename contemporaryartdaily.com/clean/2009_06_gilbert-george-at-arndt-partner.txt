The exhibition features a selection of 20 large-scale pieces from the Jack Freak Pictures, the largest Gilbert &amp; George group of pictures to date. It is the first Gilbert &amp; George solo show in Berlin for 14 years. The colors and shapes of the Union Jack flag dominate the larger part of the pictures. Medals, emblems and trees reoccur as motives throughout the series as well as ever-present visual fragments of the hometown of the London-based artists. The result is a fascinating kaleidoscopic mix of the monstrously grotesque with an intricate ornamental structure reminiscent of sacred art.
A fully illustrated catalogue will be published to accompany the exhibition.
