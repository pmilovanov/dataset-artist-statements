Clarice Lispector* says:
Anyone who lives, knows, even without knowing, that he or she knows
I know words; I know the world. That’s pretty much all I know as far as I know (well, I also know me (which is different than I of course)). I know (that I know) that other people seem to know too and this usually helps out a lot. But as we idiomize in English, “you never know”.
“People” was my first title for this exhibition. It seemed to have a good tenor to it, but then I realized it had other tenors as well. Hmmm: the world in so many words: perhaps a journey, because journey[s] have a certain tenor too. And then how to name the less known. Why? I don’t know (you know what I mean).
There’s a song named “Don’t Know What You Got (Till It’s Gone)” by a band named Cinderella with words that always speak to me:
All things [sic] come and go; all that’s left are the words
The singer, Tom Kiefer, then lets out a touching/touched whimper-plea:
I can’t let go
In other words, the Grateful Dead begin:
If my words did glow, with the cold [sic] of sunshine
Their plaintive-cum-exultant minstrelsy ending in:
If I knew the way, I would take you home
Followed by words that are not quite words
