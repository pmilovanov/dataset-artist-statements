The Power Station is pleased to announce its Fall 2012 exhibition, “I AM REAL ESTATE,” by New York-‐based artist Nikolas Gambaroff.
An artist working in multiple mediums including painting, sculpture, and video, Nikolas Gambaroff tends to approach his work with a concern for painting, its reception, and ideological entanglements. Asking always in a different manner what painting is and can be today, the work challenges traditional assumptions associated with its production and display.
I AM REAL ESTATE will present a new body of work, including paintings and sculptural elements. Paintings will, in their presented form, have been cut up and re-assembled to resemble different architectural tropes throughout the space, presenting themselves at different points as framing devices, support-structures, sculptures.
