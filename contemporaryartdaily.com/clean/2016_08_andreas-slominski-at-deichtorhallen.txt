Andreas Slominski (born 1959) is one of the most remarkable representatives of a new spirit of sculpture and installation art. He made a name for himself with his trap objects beginning in the late 1980s as well as his seemingly absurd performances, whose practical use bore no relation to the effort involved in them. Now a major new project by the artist will be presented from 14 May to 21 August 2016 at the Deichtorhallen in Hamburg.
Slominski created a large-scale installation especially for the Deichtorhallen with portable toilets that symbolize the ongoing development of our cities. In the exhibition, the artist will present over one hundred of these portable plastic toilets—industrial products that mutate into independent artworks. Some of them will be decorated in a surprising inversion as pictorial objects on the wall. Parts of these portable toilets, including the urinal, the toilet seat, and even the toilet paper holder, will be arranged on the walls like colorful panel paintings or in the room like sculptures. Like many of his works, this new large-scale project is also full of amazement and amusement.
“In his art, Andreas Slominski combines humor, sarcasm, engagement, absoluteness, and an enjoyment of art. He is a master of aesthetic double strategies. We are looking forward to his spectacular show at the Deichtorhallen,” says Dirk Luckow, General Director of the Deichtorhallen.
Andreas Slominski is among the most renowned German artists around the world. His work has a special connection to Hamburg, not only due to the fact that he studied and now serves as a professor at the Hochschule für bildende Künste. He has been invited to present solo exhibitions at numerous renowned institutions around the world, including the Kunsthaus Zürich, the Fondazione Prada in Milan, and the Museum Boijmans van Beuningen in Rotterdam.
