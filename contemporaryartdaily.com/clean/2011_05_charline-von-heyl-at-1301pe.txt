1301PE is pleased to present its second solo exhibition with New York based artist Charline von Heyl. The exhibition will feature new paintings and works on paper.
Charline von Heyls bold paintings are untamable. Each painting with its individual logic stimulates an open-ended on-going series of experiences. Within the same work von Heyls painting can conjoin doubt and ecstasy, states of intoxication and sober insight. Her paintings command our attention. They arrest the viewer intellectually, physically and emotionally.
For me, what makes a painting is a mixture of authority and freedom, where it really just wants to be itself, where there is no justification, or explanation, or anything like that. Where itʼs just what it is for whatever reason.
Charline von Heyls paintings do not sit still, as the eye searches attempting to trace layers, strokes &amp; patches. The mind taking in this new information also shifts, creating its own images, activating our participation. Similar to Alice who cried curioser and curiouser as she tumbled down the rabbit hole, when traversing von Heyls paintings one spirals through an on-going series of events in which everything seems possible, and we enter that other world of imagination. In its juxtapositions, contrasts, and unyielding von Heyls paintings make the case for paintingʼs power to provoke.
Charline von Heyl was born in Germany. She lives and works in New York. Her work has been exhibited both in the United States and internationally including solo exhibitions at the Le Consortium, Dijon, Worcester Art Museum, Dallas Museum of Art and Vienna Secession with major upcoming solo exhibitions at ICA Philadelphia, Tate Liverpool, ICA Boston and Kunsthalle Nürnberg, Germany. Released this year is the major monograph, Charline von Heyl, Paintings: 1990-2010, published by Les presses du réel.
