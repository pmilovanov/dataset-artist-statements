The group show 1.–3. Person singular/ plural brings together contemporary artworks that deal with questions of identity and (inter)subjectivity. The grammatical form alludes to the impact of norms and attributions on the individual. The artworks in the show are linked to the personal pronouns in order to focus on related topics such as selfimage, desire, gender and community.
One aim of the exhibition 1.–3. Person singular: ich,du,er/sie/es is to display non-normative identities, and to blur the borders between the self and the other, between different genders, between human and non-human. Intersubjectivity to that effect is visualized by means of curatorial settings and juxtapositions.
The second part of the exhibition, 1.-3. Person plural: wir, ihr, sie is dealing with questions of identity and socialization. Family, community rituals, visual practices of affiliation and othering are being examined. The works on display are characterized by a search for breakups and bordercrossings, and a practice of participant observation and artistic research.
