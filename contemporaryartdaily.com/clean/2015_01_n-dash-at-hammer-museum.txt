N. Dash’s work in drawing, painting, and photography is rooted in her ongoing experimentation with materials. Constantly occupying her hands with working small bits of fabric between her fingers, Dash’s intentional process of touch yields artifacts that are the building blocks of her work. When the greyed, fraying fabric is just short of losing its structural integrity, Dash sets it aside and takes up a new piece of fabric to begin the process again. She then photographs these “artifacts”, arranging them individually or in small groups. The resulting silver gelatin prints range in scale and communicate the artifacts’ presence and meaning as manifestations of process, labor, thought, and time—they are the tangible evidence of intangible phenomena. Hammer Projects: N. Dash will include thirteen new photographs and a special project for the courtyard light boxes, taking these fabric works as a starting point. Along with her photographs, the exhibition will include new paintings. Since her first visit to an adobe building in New Mexico in 2003, Dash has worked with a variation on traditional adobe on jute in her paintings. Also working with naturally derived indigo and ochre; prepared oil and acrylic paints; canvas and linen, she combines stretched and unstretched elements into carefully constructed compositions that refer to both landscape and architecture. Often large in scale, they offer an immersive experience that suggests a portal to an ephemeral elsewhere. Organized by guest curator Corrina Peipon, Hammer Projects: N. Dash is the artists first one-person museum exhibition.
