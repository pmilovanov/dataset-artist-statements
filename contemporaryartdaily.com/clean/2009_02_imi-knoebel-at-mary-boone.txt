On 8 January 2009 the Mary Boone Gallery will open at its Chelsea location an exhibition of recent works by IMI KNOEBEL.
Born in 1940 in Dessau, Germany, Imi Knoebel was preeminent among the students of Joseph Beuys at the influential Kunstakademie Düsseldorf. There he began to question the conventions and objectives of creating art. Knoebel’s work has since conjoined painting, sculpture, and architecture, culminating in the purist investigation of space, picture support and color of his recent works.
The large “paintings” in the present show are constructions that layer and jux- tapose grids of monochrome strips with planes of pure color. These modular components propose seemingly endless variations on the relationship of ab- straction to geometry and form.
Imi Knoebel’s epic painting cycle “24 Colors – for Blinky” (1977) is currently installed at Dia: Beacon, in Beacon, New York. A major retrospective of Knoe- bel’s work will open at the Hamburger Bahnhof and the Neue Nationalgalerie Berlin in Summer 2009.
The present exhibition, at 541 West 24 Street, is on view through 14 February 2009. Please contact the Gallery for further information, or visit our website www.maryboonegallery.com .
