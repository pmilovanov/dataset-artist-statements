●●●
At 1857 a cluster of pieces are gathered, all conceived for the occasion. The title,✚, has to be understood as an ironic reference to the rich exhibition history of Swiss art at home and abroad (Freie Sicht aufs Mittelmeer, Swiss Made Präzison und Wahnsinn, Beispiel: Schweiz, Saus und Braus etc.). 
Art exhibitions on the Swiss art scene have become a curatorial perennial in recent decades. The ways and forms by which artistic discourses and art scenes were institutionally represented, labeled and utilized have often been criticized. The flyer for ✚ references a notorious insert that Niele Toroni made for a catalog of Swiss art in the 1970s and –80s, in which Swiss crosses were filled with folkloristic imagery.
