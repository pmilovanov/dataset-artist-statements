Kunsthall Stavanger is proud to present the first exhibition in Norway by the prolific New York based feminist artist Judith Bernstein.
Since the 1960s, Bernstein has brazenly provoked audiences and institutions alike with her furious visceral paintings and drawings addressing themes of warfare, sexual aggression, and gender politics – often under the guise of outrageous humor. This exhibition brings together a selection of iconic works from Bernstein’s early career with many newer, never-before seen paintings and drawings. Selections from the artist’s Fuck Vietnam series, her quintessential Screw Drawings and an encompassing Signature Piece are combined with her newer, jewel-toned Dick in a Head drawings and brightly-fluorescent Birth of the Universe paintings to trace an incredible, decades-long continuity in subject matter and visual language, while revealing an explicit development in form. As with all of Bernstein’s work, the artworks included in this exhibition are deeply personal, urgent, and universally accessible.
