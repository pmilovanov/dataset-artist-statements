Miniaturized here are some buildings that I frequent in my neighborhood, all within four blocks of my apartment.
&nbsp;
The Bar Downstairs
I live above a noisy dive bar. You can tell the storefront has been many things in its long history. The Building is old: the floors and ceilings slant in different directions, the hallways sag as if the building is tired, certain details have been coated with so many layers of paint that they have become vague and soft.

FDR 99 Cent Slice Pizza 
This place makes good cheap pizza. The small storefront was built into the alley between a large tenement building and an apartment building. It is all business in there, no place to sit and there is barely room for three people to order.
&nbsp;
Bank of America 
This is the closest branch to my house. While I am reluctant to bank with this corporation, Iâ€™ve used them since I first opened an account when I was thirteen. The apartments above the bank have been left out, their architectural style clashed with the neoclassical bank portion when, already, the modernism of the bank was forcefully inserted into a much older building.
&nbsp;
Gentle Wash 
I do my laundry at this coin operated location. There is a change machine on premises. The only time I use drop off service is for sheets and towels. How does one fold a fitted sheet? I have made a decision to exclude the fire escape on this building. It is an unusual shape but it is ugly and caked in pigeon poop. There is a large tree obscuring most of this building so the entirety is covered in pigeon droppings.
&nbsp;
Rite Aid
I buy certain sundries at this location. It is two blocks from my house and is open 24 hours. Sometimes people graffiti on the mural but it gets painted over very quickly. They must have a mural company on retainer. There are bees and butterflies.
