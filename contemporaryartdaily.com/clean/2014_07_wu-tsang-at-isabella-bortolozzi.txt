For Berlin Gallery Weekend 2014, Galerie Isabella Bortolozzi will present a solo presentation of the Los Angeles based artist Wu Tsang.
Central to the exhibition is a 2-channel film entitled A day in the life of bliss, which simultaneously explores cinematic and performative narrative. The film follows BLIS (played by boychild), who inhabits a near future world in which our social media avatars and online personas developed their own hive-minded consciousness called LOOKS. BLIS is a celebrity- collaborator by day and underground performer by night, who discovers her ability to challenge the Looks. Utilizing sci-fi genre tropes and melodrama, the film evokes a classic outsider narrative that is complicated by affect, movement, and body politics. The artists work has recently been shown at Tate Modern, London, Museum of Modern Art, New Museum New York; ICA Philadelphia; and the Museum of Contemporary Art and REDCAT Los Angeles. In 2012, he participated in the Whitney Biennial and New Museum Triennial in New York, the Gwangju Biennial and the Liverpool Biennial. He was named one of Filmmaker Magazine’s “25 New Faces of Independent Film” in 2012. His first feature WILDNESS won the Grand Jury Prize for Outstanding Documentary at Outfest 2012.
