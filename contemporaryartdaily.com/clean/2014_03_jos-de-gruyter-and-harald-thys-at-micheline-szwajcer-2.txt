Years ago we saw them for the first time, in the station of L. They were drunk and held each other firmly. Their pants hung low and their shirts were full of stains. They made jokes about trivial things. With every joke they burst out laughing and tottered.
These men are in a state of total indifference. They can only make stupid jokes or become very angry. If they are angry, they may even kill their best friend. Sometimes they badly beat each other, they knock each other out and when they wake up, they forget what happened and patch each other up again.
They turn up occasionally. One does not see them often. When it gets hot they sleep off their hangovers in their dens. They are more likely to appear on gloomy days, when wet snow starts to fall. Then one sees them stumble in the distance. Usually they have liquor with them. They seek each other out on the outskirts of large cities. They feel best in wastelands or dirty forests.
These men are allergic to social positivism and utilitarianism. They abhor humans who aspire to physical health, labour and reasonable material wealth. They see themselves as the enemy of this. Without realising it, they rule over a subterranean kingdom.
Rather no light than false light, rather a completely irrational but fully underground existence than a highly rational and scarred existence.
That is their motto.
