Drawing was probably one of the first artistic things Ken Price (1935–2012) did, even before he started surfing the beaches at Malibu and playing jazz trumpet. Price drew to visualize how an object—be it a cup, egg, specimen, or mound—might get made. He also drew to relax and stretch out, to improvise imaginary scenes of retinal-searing color, and, at times, to fantasize. For years he drew with no audience in mind, and in the unfettered space of his imagination, drawing flourished. 
The first survey of Price’s lifelong rapport with drawing, Slow and Steady Wins the Race includes 65 works on paper from 1962 to 2010 and features the ten-foot, ink-on-paper scroll he conceived during a formative trip to Japan in 1962. Unfurling with autobiographical scenes paced by handwritten texts, the illuminated scroll sets this show’s tone with Price’s signature cartoon humor and sculptural innuendo. Throughout the exhibition sculptural themes complement more narrative-infused scenarios. From 2000 until his death, the sculptor sustained a quiet storm of creativity that included prolific stints of drawing: images of erupting volcanoes and lava lakes, lightning-struck bodies of water, desert craters, mutant trees, trailers occupying surreal landscapes, and an ominous bottomless pit. In the twilight of Price’s life, the intimate act of drawing was solace.
