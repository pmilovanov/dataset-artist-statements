Mr. C?
Have you seen Mr. C? What is he doing? What are her skills? He can do this, or she can do that.
Mr. C is messy. He likes to rearrange things and build objects. To understand them, she sometimes needs to attach them one to another with a string.
Mr. C has the faculty to split herself in two, simultaneously revealing his insides and her own flesh. Each part stares at– and is the reflection of– the other. They are always a bit different; they discover unexpected things.
Mr. C walks funny. She has no shadow. He can read minds, and turn dreams into reality.
Mr. C speaks a thousand languages, but understands none of them. She lives in a different place everyday. Always in motion; from city to forest. Mr. C has a house built on stilts, surrounded by clouds.
Mr. C travels through time and space and has a removable face. He flies at high speed, high in the sky, and dives deep in the ocean, always looking for something.
