With In the Museum Trilogy Mathis Gasser (*1984 in Zurich, lives and works in London) creates an ongoing narrative. The setting is a fictional but archetypical museum, where a Christopher Walken fan puppet comes across zombies and come alive hand-made replicas of well-known and obscure works from art history. The museum is depicted as a place for the «undead,» where the boundaries between this world and the nether world must be continually negotiated. In the Museum Trilogy reflects on the institution of the museum as an allegory for a general, broader link between (pop) culture and political and socioeconomic conditions, and asks concrete (institutional-critical) questions about the current social and cultural function of the museum. At the center of the solo show of Mathis Gasser lies his new film In the Museum 3 that forms a trilogy together with In the Museum 1-2 (2010-2017). The films are being presented along with sculptural works and paintings.
