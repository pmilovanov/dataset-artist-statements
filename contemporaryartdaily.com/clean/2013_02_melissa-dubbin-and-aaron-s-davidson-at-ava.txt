Making a Record (Diamond, Ruby, Sapphire, Emerald) centers around a series of four interviews the artists conducted in 2009 with gemologist and jewelry designer Karen L. Davidson, talking about the stones used to record her voice. The artists made lithic tools from the four gemstones and etched a series of unique lathe-cut dub plates of each interview. Each of the four gemstone styli were given to Karen to use as elements in four pieces she designed. These handmade pieces are composed of the stylus, crystal slices or stones in their natural states, cut gems and 22k gold. Each of the four pieces can be worn as a pendant.
Sofía Hernández, Chong Cuy, Pierre Huyghe, Marina Warner, and Jamieson Webster were invited by the artists to listen to the records and wear the pendants, exhibiting them for varied lengths of time. The information contained on the records was transmitted through casual conversations and occurrences that took place during their daily lives. A record of these instances has been contributed by each individual and will be presented over the course of the show at AVA.
Melissa Dubbin and Aaron S. Davidson began working collaboratively in 1998. Recent solo shows include exhibitions at Henie Onstad Kunstsenter, Høvikodden, Norway (2012), and The Living Art Museum, Reykjavik, Iceland (2012). Their work is currently on view in the group show The Unspecific Index, at 601Artspace, New York, NY. They will be in residence at Recess in Soho in late March 2013. This is their first solo exhibition in New York.
