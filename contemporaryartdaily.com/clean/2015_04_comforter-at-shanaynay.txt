A balance overhead
Turns into a “look at
What could be an instead:
Oblique;” maybe mislead
By whatever gets at
The balance overhead:
The cousins of the dead
Encourage to lay flat.
What could be an instead?
Nothing’s always imbed
Although we can aim at
A balance overhead.
Tripped up by a thin thread
(What’s that? A peek, a pat?)
Which could be an instead.
The things that stay unsaid,
Like ennui, still say that
A balance overhead
Perhaps could be instead.
