The four paintings in the exhibition have been developed during the Winter 2013/14 at the studio in Lausanne. The time spent on each single painting increased, slowing down the speed of work. For days and weeks a canvas was passing through several different forms.
Untitled LVII The painting on the left hand side is made with synthetic brushes. The shapes are painted with Talens oil color. Graded green tones are mixed on the palette and layered directly on the canvas. These colored areas dont touch, while the emerging line displays a carmine acrylic paint surface. 2014, Oil and acrylic on canvas, 160 × 110cm
Untitled LVIII The starting layer of the largest work in the show is painted colorfully. Then all fields are covered with a silver tone. The Light Sky Blue painted background becomes lines. 2014, Oil and acrylic on canvas, 230 × 170cm
White tones, black lines, permanent green The polyester canvas is mounted on a board. The permanent green is acrylic, the black lines and the white tones are painted in oil color. At the edge of the painting a stained wooden lath is nailed on. 2014, Oil and acrylic on canvas, 185 × 126cm
Metallic Painting Executed in Lascaux Aluminium, Steel and Britannia Silver, the metallic shapes are outlined in black. The composition is applied on a white background which continues into the space of the gallery. 2014, Oil and acrylic on canvas, 202 × 127cm
