Renwick is pleased to invite Pro Choice to New York to present artists Wolfgang Breuer and Anita Leisz.
Pro Choice is an exhibition space in Vienna run by Will Benedict and Lucie Stahl. Recent exhibitions include solo shows by Julian Goethe, Gaylen Gerber, Michaela Eichwald, and two-person shows by Lucy Dodd and Sergei Tcherepnin, Josef Strau and Clegg&amp;Guttmann, and Ei Arakawa and Nikolas Gambaroff.
Wolfgang Breuers work is not for you because he is auditioning for the police and the check out aisle of the supermarket.
The works of Anita Leisz are made up of the minute details created by chance and repetition which give a sidewalk its patina or a sofa the particular contours of its owner.
Wolfgang Breuer lives and works in London and Berlin. Recent exhibitions include Establissement den face. Br端ssels; Simultanhalle, Cologne; Basso, Berlin; Pro Choice, Vienna; Galerie Meerrettich im Glaspavillon an der Volksb端hne, Berlin.
Anita Leisz lives and works in Vienna. Recent exhibitions include Galerie Mayer Kainer, Vienna; Salzburger Kunstverein, Salzburg; Haus der Kunst, Munich; Kunstverein N端rnberg, N端rnberg.
