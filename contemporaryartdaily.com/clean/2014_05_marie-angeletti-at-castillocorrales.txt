No oneâ€™s terribly good at waiting these days. Life is almost like leading a battle over nearly all and almost everything to keep up with a schedule. So for the sanity of everyone, we are going to make this rather brief.
The exhibition Ciao by French artist Marie Angeletti (b. 1984) at castillo/corrales offers a different experience of time, by pointing at moments when time is made distinctive, or by enabling social situations where it is enriched. A late night conversation between old friends where masks suddenly fall off; a puzzling series of emotional happenstances; a long-awaited house party: in the work of Marie Angeletti, the exhibition takes on different configurations where time suddenly stops being an urgent affair.



Ciao aims at producing a less sleek, less inertial kind of exhibition, one that embraces relationships between persons and images, making them carriers of meaning and bestowers of significance.
