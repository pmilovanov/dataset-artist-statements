The underground is something believed to be experienced by an other, a personality so egregiously different, so unlike one’s own, that its point-of-view is, frankly, who cares. Nothing comes in singles though, lot’s of things care, about anything. Lot’s of sentient beings enjoy a good fight. A good
head shot. A good field plowing. The soil is a domain ruled from a place of vengeance, using the chemicals and tactics of war.
Good old-fashioned fun for General Monsantosaurus.
EVEN THE TERM BEING IS TOO BENIGN A COMPLIMENT FOR THESE PUNY CREATURES. MINOR SHADOWS THAT ARE LITTLE MORE THAN RANDOM VEHICLES OF INEFFECTUAL AND INEFFICIENT FLESH.
“Now Stuart, if you look at the soil around any large U.S. city with a big
underground homosexual population Des Moines, Iowa, perfect example. Look at the soil around Des Moines, Stuart. You can’t build on it, you can’t grow anything in it. The government says it’s due to poor farming. But I know what’s really going on, Stuart. I know it’s the queers“
YOU HAVE NO RIGHTS! NO PRIVILEGES! NO PLACE IN THE SCHEME OF THINGS. MERE CATTLE YOU WANDER WEAKLY IN PALTRY PLACES BEGGING TO BE BROUGHT TO YOUR KNEES AND SLAUGHTERED.
The world is complicated, and pleasure is a dart.
Some nations land on mass incarceration, others outdoor prison camps, others love to collect nude pics, the Stasi kept dissident’s smell in jars (ew)
Whatever floats their boats. The whole guilt game is a false flag, likeupon approaching an ‘’’inconvenient truth’’ comes the sensing of guilt and its implications. The rejection of that guilt feels like a personal emancipatory gesture. The denial almost feels like one is resisting the authority pleasuring itself with the sad truths of modern society. Sure thing.
CHAINED AND SHACKLED BY YOUR MYTHS YOU ESPOUSE “FREEDOM” AND BREED CAPTIVITY. PLAN PUERILE PALACES AND BUILD DISEASE RIDDEN DUNGEONS. SLAVES! HAVE YOU EVER BEEN FREEDOM?
“.You know what Stuart, I like you. You’re not like the other people, here in the trailer park.“
AS YOU SERVE YOUR FLESH ON GOLDEN PLATTERS TO THOSE YOU WOULD TRUST WITH YOUR UTOPIA DO YOU SENSE THE COMEDY THAT YOU ARE? AT THE BANQUET THAT MARKS YOUR UNCLEAN DEMISE.
Someone will be having their head cut off in 2017 and stuck on an other‘s body. Plenty of people just like the head being cut off part. There are so many heads being cut off these days! Huge potential there.
ROMANTICIZE FREEDOM AS YOU PLEASE! YOUR SENTIMENTALITY IS MERELY SICKNESS. HUMANITY NO MORE THAN A LOATHSOME WRETCHED CONVENIENCE! SOON, SO SOON, WE SHALL ERASE THE DECAYING COMMUNITIES YOU INHABIT AND PURGE YOUR KIND IN A FINAL FIRESTORM OF ATTRITION.
HAHAHAHA!
The early bird got the worm, and bit it in half. Luckily it left the other half on the ground, and it grew into a whole worm.
