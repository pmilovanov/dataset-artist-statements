 Looking Out the window, and into the computer looking out the window through a computer. Looking through someone elses camera, and someone elses time at work, or travel.
SoRy fraccing very busy
last day with Arctic hope my replacement gets here soon im over this job
Its been a really long, shitty winter. Going out less and staying in more; thinking about confinement, compressed spaces,boxes, boats, tiny rooms, etc. Sensing collective isolation, in spite of everyone being linked up regardless of distance or perpetual movement.
Now its beginning to feel like Spring; we can crack open the windows again.
Simon Preston is pleased to present Josh Tonsfeldts second solo exhibition in New York.
Haha I thought you were another Josh.
Yea, feel free to use the pics. Thanks for asking.
Semester at sea was definitely an experience Ill
cherish for the rest of my life. If you ever get the opportunity, I highly recommend it.




 Good luck on the project.
Lacking a standard operating procedure or prioritized material, Tonsfeldts work is culled from experiential residue more than formal studio practice. Working on whim and through the manipulation of materials and relationships close at hand, his sculptures, videos and photographic works are placed in conversation together causing further ripples of insight and possible understanding.
His work has recently been included in the group exhibitionsLooking Back: The Fifth White Columns Annual Selected by Bob Nickas, Sculpture Centers In Practice series, and Le Faux Miroir at Rodolphe Janssen Gallery, Brussels. In February of 2010 he had a solo exhibition at Franco Soffiantino Gallery in Turin. He is also included in the current exhibition Proposal for a Floor for the Zabludowicz Collection in New York.
Loosely coinciding with this exhibition is the release of a book of photographs, edited by Bob Nickas, available at the gallery upon printing. A preview and afterward by Nickas is available at www.joshtonsfeldt.com/book
