In selecting works for the exhibition, I tended to focus on the diversity of the submissions – an inevitable feature of any annual exhibition – while at the same time distilling their heterogeneity into a single common denominator: the everyday. Thus, the exhibit revolves around the anecdotal, the contract, the inconspicuous, and around aesthetic forms that invoke an entire world, like a set table, a print, two sound performances, an object, embroidery, three still lifes, a cart, two rods, a bottle, two photographs, and a shirt.
