Are we living in the most conformist phase of modern history?
Why is every attempt at criticizing society simply disarmed and discredited?
Why is it that nowadays any possibility of social protest is co-opted and absorbed?
If capitalism has been able to work and develop not in spite of, but thanks to the conflicts that exist in society, why is social and political conflict vanishing from our Western society today?
How is it that criticism was so fertile and incisive during a period without economic hardship, culminating in 1968, while nowadays for all the hardship and problems society remains apathetic?
Is it true that society today no longer wants to be a society but rather has settled for putting up with itself?
Is there reason to think that possibilities still exist to generate a transformational project which society might wish to aspire to?
What would be today the image today by which society can forge a representation of affirmation and valorization for itself?
Supposing that the evolution of culture and art has some connection with the inertia and passivity that characterize the world today.The renewal of their vitality will be inseparable from a certain drive that shall yield the form and content of a new project of autonomy.
Are we troubled by the impossibility to imagine the content of such a creation?
