A group of works that describe the similarities between the eye of the painter and photographer whilst the realisation of the work appears quite different in technique. Each of the works resonates its matter with the next, helped by the sound created for the show. Nothing is static, it’s all alive, and each appear to dance through the rhythmic vibrations within their constructed category, whether it be high definition ink jet print or ink painted on canvas.
