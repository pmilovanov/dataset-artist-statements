Using whatever materials and methods are available, as a system.
All the while attempting to embrace the Monumental, for the first time. These efforts result in a variety of sculptures made out of stainless steel, spray painted metal, plastic, canvas, leather, walnuts, chrome plated steel, rope, concrete, laminated wood, a Maroccan rug and other found objects.
Harvesting simplified forms, with new ambitions.
An exhibition constructed around the architecture of a cultured landscape. Where the gallery functions as a public square, an interior for the great outdoors. Working within this confined court leaves room for sidesteps, detours, and some repetition.
Get a grip on. Grasp.
Walk steady, don’t run, never sweat. That is a pace I’d like to keep.
The great handyman that was my grandfather claimed that in the workshop, the ones sweating were at work, the others at play.
Playtime.
