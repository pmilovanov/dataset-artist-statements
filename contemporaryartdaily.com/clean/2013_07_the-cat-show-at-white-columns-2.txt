“Ladies and Gentleman, cats and kitties, I give you a show that deserves to travel to every small museum and university gallery in the country: The Cat Show at White Columns; brilliantly curated by excellent writer Rhonda Lieberman. Go. See. Purr. Pine.” Jerry Saltz
Due to the overwhelming success of ‘The Cats-in-Residence Program’ adoptions will be extended to every Friday and Saturday for the duration of the show, excluding July 4 weekend.
The Cat Show celebrates cats of all shapes, sizes and subjectivities with cat-alytic work by over 50 artists. Conceived and organized by Rhonda Lieberman, the centerpiece is The Cats-in-Residence Program’ where adoptable purr-formers, a.k.a. cats, from Social Tees Animal Rescue, lounge on feline fine art and run amok in a pussy playground designed by architects and hopefully find forever homes.
Samantha Brody of Social Tees said, “The cats were having the time of their lives the artist-designed enclosure is like a jungle gym/spa for kitties. And the visitors (especially those who went inside the enclosure!) were just as overjoyed as the cats. It was awesome to see so many faces light up.”




Adoption events occur during gallery hours of 12-6pm on the following days:
June 21 – 22
June 28 – 29
July 12 – 13
July 19 – 20
Come to White Columns to enjoy the purr-formance and add a kitty to your collection.
