This summer the Stedelijk Museum presents Jan Dibbets’ recent series New Color Studies (2010-2014) in four of the top-floor galleries. This series is based on two negatives of car bodywork, shot in 1976.

The New Color Studies are presented in conjunction with the original Color Studies series from the 1970s. Dibbets printed the images at the maximum size afforded by the state of technology at the time. Forty years later, today’s digital techniques allow for extreme enlargements, which led to this new series of monumental ‘abstract’ color studies.


Dutch artist Jan Dibbets (1941) is one of the most distinguished and influential figures in the international art world. Dibbets’ work explores questions relating to light, the mechanisms of perception, perspective and space.
