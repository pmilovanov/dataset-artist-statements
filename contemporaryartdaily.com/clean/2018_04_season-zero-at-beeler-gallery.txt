Beeler Gallery at Columbus College of Art &amp; Design presents How well do you behave? IN THE FLAT FIELD.. This is Season Zero. It brings together printed historical materials from various fields. From art and design school printed matter (Portikus, ÉCAL, Cranbrook Academy of Art, Villa Arson), to radical literature archive (Black &amp; Red Books and Detroit Printing Co-Op), from fashion runway invitations (Eckhaus Latta) to a philosopher’s notes (Alain Badiou), from a 1970 art tabloid (Culture Hero) to Columbus’ first art book fair. With an ethos of slow programming, these materials will accumulate throughout the season. Things will come and go and stay for different durations. This is not an exhibition.
How can aesthetic, political, and intellectual urgency be conveyed and designed in the present moment? We look at —and look back at —these materials not as artifacts but as media-screens of first encounters. How well do we behave towards materials? How well do materials behave back? What resonances and resistance are there for the here and now? And finally, what responsibilities does a gallery situated in an art and design school have in the present moment?
• Micro-histories of art and design schools through their printed matter: the architectural motif of the portico in the posters of Portikus, Städelschule since its beginning (Frankfurt, Germany), the arrivals of American artists at Villa Arson (Nice, France. Selection and reflection by Julien Bouillon, and further reflections by Julie Béna and Sergio Verastegui), lecture series and exhibition postcards by the in-house printing facility of ÉCAL (Lausanne, Switzerland. Reflections by Stéphane Kropf), and the promotional posters for the various departments at Cranbrook Academy of Art (Bloomfield Hills, Michigan)by Katherine McCoy and Michael McCoy, many produced alongside students in the 1970s and 1980s.
• The archive of Black &amp; Red Books and the Detroit Printing Co-Op, featuring the first unauthorized English 1970 edition of Guy Debord’s influential 1967 book The Society of the Spectacle.
