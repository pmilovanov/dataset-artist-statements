The Chantal Crousel gallery is proud to announce a solo exhibition by Seth Price, his first in France.
Most of the works in the exhibition started with a small, quick sketch by the artist, which he scanned, enlarged, digitally manipulated, and printed on sheets of plastic. The plastic was then vacuum-formed over randomly-placed ropes and painted with acrylic, enamel and polyurethane. Price has worked with both ropes and vacuum-formed plastic for several years, but this is the first time he has expanded these techniques into the realm of representational drawing and painting. As is often the case with Priceâ€™s work a coherent and clear position is avoided, and the meanings here of satirical caricature, abstraction, or even painting itself, are unstable or unresolved.
Price also exhibits a short story, written and narrated by the artist, as an audio piece with French subtitles projected nearby. A transcript of the story is available at the gallery.
