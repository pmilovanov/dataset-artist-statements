SHAPESHIFTER
Animal, vegetable, mineral:
I am the answerer and you are the questioner. Try to reveal my form.
Am I bigger than a breadbox?
Can you put me in your mouth?
If I am the leg of a table, am I vegetable?
Adopt my alien form and use me to feel brand new.
Use me to feel like a child and to remind you of your value, potential and weakness. Reflect me, rotate me, and transform me.
I am a Shapeshifter and I am good to have around.
Use me for good and for evil, I dare you to decipher my codes.
Keep me in your pocket to squeeze in your palm.
Legends have it that I transform over time. After all, all you need is time.
Observe how the sunlight affects me because if you blink you may miss my next outfit.
Appropriate my signs and shine my symbols.
Dig me out of the ground from beneath the earth: centuries of dirt, weather and ware. Dust me off and kiss my many faces.
Classifying me will get you nowhere, because I can be anything you want me to be.
You brought me inside because my shape reminds you of another time. My color reminds you of the wind.
What you accept, I protest.
You like that I lead by example.
I followed you inside because you remind me of something too.
