During the summer months, the migros museum für gegenwartskunst sculpture project, The Garden of Forking Paths, will be a guest on the Froh Ussicht estate, owned by the Blum family in Samstagern, ZH. The project alludes to Sacro Bosco in Bomarzo (Italy), the enchanted Renaissance garden, rediscovered in the 20th century, which features sculptures shrouded in mystery, and eccentric architecture that over time became overgrown (so-called “follies”). The invited artists will create their own fantastic narratives. This will take place throughout the grounds of the family estate and introduce rich fields of tension to the rationalistic logic of the actual site. The project title refers to a story by Argentinean novelist Jorge Luis Borges (1899-1986), indicating the analogy between imagination and spatial structures, in which he described the labyrinth as possibly the most fundamental human experience. Entwined with the ideas from the enchanted garden of Sacro Bosco, the project yields a mythical, cerebral cosmos, in which the artists can integrate their work in their own ways.
The sculpture project is curated by Heike Munder. It is a guest on the Froh Ussicht estate, which is owned by the Blum family in Samstagern ZH and has been hosting art projects since 2008. Further information can be found at: frohussicht.ch. An anthology will be produced for the project in September 2011, published by JRP|Ringier.
