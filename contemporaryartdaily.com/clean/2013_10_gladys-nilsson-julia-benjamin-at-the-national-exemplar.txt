Gladys Nilsson, an original member of the Chicago Imagists, is one of Americaâ€™s most compelling watercolorists. In her works, which are figurative, mystical and surreal, she transmutes real stories into a new universe of her own creation. Her paintings depict a labyrinth of images, dense masses of people in motion, small figures balancing atop much bigger ones, overlapping and fighting with each other for space, all of it creating a kind of floating narrative.
Julia Benjamin makes abstract paintings.
Both artists play with the delicate balance/unbalance of planes and movement.
Gladys Nilsson was born in 1940. She attended the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. She lives and works in Wilmette, IL.
Julia Benjamin was born in 1984. She studied painting at the Rhode Island School of Design and at Columbia University. She lives and works in NY.
