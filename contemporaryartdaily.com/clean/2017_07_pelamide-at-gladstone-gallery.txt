Gladstone Gallery is pleased to present Pélamide, a group exhibition curated by Lilou Vidal, featuring works by: Nel Aerts, Michael Bauer, Marianne Berenhaut, Michaela Eichwald, Rodrigo Hernández, Cameron Jamie, Ana Jotta, Pierre Klossowski, Gabriel Kuri, Sarah Lucas, Victor Man, Marisa Merz, J Parker Valentine, Walter Swennen and Pieter Vermeersch.
Pélamide presents a dialogue with the selected artists of free association, uniting and highlighting elusive, strange, biomorphic and self-determined forms. This exhibition explores the discursive and sensual visuality of art and poetry, and the ways in which these forms serve as sources of disinformation and openness.
This exhibition is organized around poetry as a framework; Pélamide is structured around Tristan Tzara’s 1918 Dadaist poetry volume, “The Twenty-Five Poems,” which puts forward a new form of syntax formed by deconstructing the composition of speech and narration. In tribute to the Dadaist aleatory game, each of the twenty-five works selected are coupled with one of the twenty-five poems by Tzara, paired according to their placement in the exhibition space, creating new and spontaneous textual experiences that a viewer can visually and conceptually explore. Rather than proposing an analytical and theoretical answer to what an exhibition can be, or to speculate the meaning of the artwork, Pélamide proposes an anachronic and shared endeavor to extend the potentials of perception.
