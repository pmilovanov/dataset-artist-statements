greengrassi is pleased to present Pae Whites fifth exhibition at the gallery. The work, titled Genau or Never, is a reconfiguration of an unrealized commission originally planned for Gloucester Road tube station. In this iteration, a small portion of the original plan has been processed through a randomizer as a way to recontextualize it within a space with a new set of concerns. While the previous version utilized nearly 2450 tubes of neon referencing ornamental motifs from a mythical magic carpet, the new version is what occurs as that carpet unravels: unencumbered by its former logic and site, the ornament is set free, generating its own logic for its new environment.
The 540 neon tubes used here represent a variation on white, each specifically selected because of its resemblance to daylight. Exposure to this kind of illumination enhances feelings of wellbeing; the tonal shifts that result from the different LUX levels in the neon allowing it to function as a giant SAD lamp during a seasonally dark time.
