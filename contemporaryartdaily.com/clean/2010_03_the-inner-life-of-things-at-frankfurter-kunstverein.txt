The works and projects by Nina Canell, Florian Haas, Till Krause, Bettina Lauck, Yoon Jean Lee, Egill Sæbjörnsson and Andreas Wegner present various methods in the search for the “inner life of thing”. They show painterly, photographic or filmed effigies of mundane objects, for example bottles, glasses, balls, stones, mushrooms, flowers, tools, toys or everyday products. 

 Adopting diverse observational and representational approaches, they attempt to draw conclusions on the being of objects, by way of their forms. They thereby produce something fundamentally new too: apparently found or artificially created objects reveal quite unexpected traits through serial photographic analysis and staged or contextual configurations.
The works brought together in the exhibition question in exemplary fashion the character of the “real world” as well as the observer’s relationship to it. In addition to the seven artistic positions taken, some exhibits from the Sammlung des Museum der Dinge / Werkbundarchiv (Berlin) will be on display.
