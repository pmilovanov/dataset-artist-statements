Konrad Fischer Galerie is pleased to announce the opening of a show with new works by Jerry Zeniuk on November 12, 2010.
In the nineties the work of the painter Jerry Zeniuk based in New York and Munich was known only by a small group of connoisseurs. Twenty years earlier in the early seventies, gallerists and curators, among them Konrad Fischer, learned about the work’s significance through his inclusion in exhibitions such as Fundamental Painting and Radical Painting where Zeniuk showed alongside Brice Marden, Robert Ryman, Agnes Martin, Gerhard Richter and Robert Mangold.
Presently Zeniuk’s oeuvre consists of about 310 large-sized paintings without titles, the Untitled Numbers, numbered in order of completion and ranging in size from ca. 30 x 30 cm up to 300 x 750 cm. He has also produced many beautiful prints, watercolors and oil pastels on hand-made paper.
The method of Zeniuk’s paintings is not the subjective, spontaneous gesture, but an autonomous arrangement which is confined to a pre-determined process or plan, in which the element of time plays an important role: The paintings emerge slowly in the hectic pace of our times. The work develops without requirements or deadlines. It’s not unusual that only six or eight paintings leave Zeniuk’s studio in a year. „The conviction of direction is an absolute one, the manner of arrival is tentative.“
The viewer is challenged trying to see and understand all aspects of Zeniuks painting, which is fine with Zeniuk, I hope my work cannot be explained.
