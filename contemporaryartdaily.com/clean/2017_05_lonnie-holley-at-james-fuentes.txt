James Fuentes is pleased to announce its forthcoming solo exhibition with Lonnie Holley, Which Do We Drop First, The Baby or The Bomb? Born in 1950, in Birmingham, Alabama, the artist currently lives and works in Atlanta, Georgia. This is his second exhibition at the gallery.
Holley’s interdisciplinary practice culminates in this exhibition featuring important sculptural works by the artist dating from 1995 to 2016. Like parables, Holley’s sculptures are both inspiring and diagrammatic. Each assemblage tells a story which seems to offer a way of living in the world.
Holley was included in the seminal exhibition More than Land and Sky: Art From Appalachia at the National Museum of American Art in 1981. He most recently presented a solo exhibition at the Atlanta Contemporary, GA (2017) entitled I Snuck off the Slave Ship. Coming up Holley will be featured at Mass MoCA as a highlighted artist in residence from the Rauschenberg Foundation in Captiva, FL. He will also be included in Animal Farm, a group exhibition curated by Sadie Laska at the Brant Foundation in Greenwich, CT. The artist is included in public collections of the American Folk Art Museum, New York, NY; Birmingham Museum of Art, Birmingham, AL; Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco; High Museum of Art, Atlanta, GA; Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York; Milwaukee Museum of Art, Milwaukee, WI; Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, TX; New Jersey State Museum, Trenton, NJ; New Orleans Museum of Art, New Orleans, LA; Philadelphia Museum of Art, Philadelphia, PA; Smithsonian American Art Museum, Washington,D.C.
