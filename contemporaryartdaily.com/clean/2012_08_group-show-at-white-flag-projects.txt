Ghosts Before Breakfast collects small gestures. Its observations might stutter, repeat, or double back, mistaking one for two, two for one, something for nothing. It is as interested in residues of things that arent here as it is in the things that are.
The objects tend to confuse their own negativity; their means and materials applied so directly as to become disorienting. Clarity verges on transparency. Eventually one sees through each artwork into a discrete, imperfect vacancy.
What was concrete is bottomless.
