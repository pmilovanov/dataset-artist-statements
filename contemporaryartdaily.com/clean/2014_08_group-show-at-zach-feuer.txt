After years of process abstraction in painting we once again come full circle to the picture. In New York City, a renewed interest in classical themes has emergedâ€”most notably the portrait, the landscape, and the still life. Approaches to painting that were once doomed to languish in obscurity on the walls of coffee shops are making a triumphant return to relevance in young and established galleries alike.
This exhibition combines works from artists who have historically dealt with representation, with those from some of the contemporary champions of its reemergence. Simply put, this one is for the picture makers.
