Indipendenza is pleased to announce the first solo exhibition in Italy by Brazilian São Paulo-based artist Lucas Arruda.
The exhibit is the outcome of a one-month residency during which the artist has created new oil paintings and light installations that are presented alongside older works to show the path of an artist whose apparently simple pictorial practice hides a remarkable richness of meanings and suggestions.
Arruda paints seascapes on small scale canvases. We don’t know if these seascapes are real or not, if they have been portrayed at dawn or at sunset or if they refer to something beyond our perception. Completed deprived of reference points we are instead rewarded with complete freedom in our personal dialogue with each artwork. We could be overwhelmed or comforted by them. The visitors are invited to take their own time, to walk through the works without any rush, to look at the paintings and then look inside themselves. Walking from one work of art to the next appears effortless at first glance, but soon reveals an intense pictorial effect through the rays of light that jump out from the canvas with great and almost violent intensity. A seemingly compositional and chromatic repetition, resulting from a thoughtful appreciation of the pictorial technique, hints at that natural monotony that makes us feel that any day is just like the one before, but will actually never be exactly the same.Lucas Arruda (b. 1983, São Paulo) lives and works in São Paulo, Brazil.
