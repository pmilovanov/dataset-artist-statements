Galerie Micheline Szwajcer presents its second solo exhibition of Hans-Peter Feldmann since 2007. The German conceptual artist will exhibit early and new works from several thematic series that represent some of his long-lasting concerns: a large collection of photographs of the Eiffel Tower, painted plaster sculptures, love couples and legs, candle lights and customized canvases.
In 1968, Feldmann gave up painting, arguing that photographs were “fully sufficient” to convey the idea of his art, and he has ever since worked primarily with reproduced images found well outside any fine-arts context. He takes them from the mass media or finds them at flea markets – magazine clippings, family snapshots, pinups, photo albums, posters, placards and amateur photography.
Hans-Peter Feldmann was born in 1941 in Düsseldorf, Germany, where he presently lives and works. He was the recipient of the 2010 Hugo Boss Award, and literally displayed this prize in his exhibition at the Guggenheim Museum, New York, filling up a room in the museum with tens of thousands of used dollar bills. His artworks have recently been featured in exhibitions at Centro de Arte Reina Sofía, Madrid, Kempner Art Museum St. Louis, and MOCAD, Detroit and at Serpentine Gallery, London. Feldmann’s work will be presented in a major monographic exhibition at Deichtorhallen, Hamburg, from 1st March to 2nd June 2013.
