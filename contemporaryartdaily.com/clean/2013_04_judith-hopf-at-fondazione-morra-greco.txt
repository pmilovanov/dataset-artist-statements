From February 22 to March 22, 2013, the Fondazione Morra Greco will be hosting from down, From Up &amp; In Between, the first solo exhibition in a neapolitan institution by the German artist Judith Hopf.
The exhibition, organized by the Fondazione Donnaregina in collaboration with the Fondazione Morra Greco, is part of the Progetto XXI exhibition project. Organized as a cycle of thirteen events, the project seeks to explore the most recent artistic output, still debated and not wholly affirmed, through which it intends to contribute to researching, sustaining and displaying the most advanced experimental art, new ideas, themes and contemporary trends.
Underlying the formalization of Judith Hopf’s work is an ironic, playful and subversive attitude which, through sculpture, video and performance art, analyzes the contradictions of contemporary life constantly defined by social conventions. Relations between the individual and the relevant context of the object become the focal point for this survey of the artist, who sees her practice as a collective process.
The exhibition organized at Palazzo Avellino stems from Judith Hopf’s reflections on the city of Naples and the deep roots of its culture, imbued with an altogether special form of spirituality. The total assimilation of a conception of the world with a pagan matrix made possible the development of a relationship with the system of Catholic beliefs that almost eliminates the concept of transcendence to relate every event to a human sphere. Even the tension between heaven and hell, the death instinct and the power of life and beauty is configured through a total mingling of the two spheres. The exhibition consists of a site-specific project that seeks to represent this cultural dimension and the tension created by two antithetical forces.
