In thought-provoking paintings, all made on small wood panels, R. H. Quaytman employs a variety of techniques and artistic vocabularies to explore the complex history of painting. The artist considers each new body of work as a new chapter in an ongoing investigation of the interrelationship of site, history, and object. With each chapter structured around a specific theme or concept, a narrative thread develops in the work over time. Quaytmans New Work exhibition debuts the 18th chapter, which uses SFMOMAs collection of photographs to reflect on Jack Spicer, a poet associated with the San Francisco Renaissance of the 1950s.
