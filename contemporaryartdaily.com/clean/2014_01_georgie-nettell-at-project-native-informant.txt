The same mechanically produced image in different colour themes has been exhibited twice before, a restyled repeat of an industry standard. The same image (the same artist) appears again via a logic by which only products that have been successful somewhere before become appropriate to be shown again. Offset to create unique variations within the same basic format, individuation is only token.
Removing the stud walls mirrors a brand that trades on transparency. Fashionable in a corrupt way, this tells us little we do not already know. Such rehearsed frictions are as fluid as anything else but to reveal an act of emptiness through mechanisms of integration will quickly become its opposite. Strategies remain strategic and signature insights become conditioned reflex. Here a standardised passivity moves towards a model of participation that is a demonstration but is also true.
