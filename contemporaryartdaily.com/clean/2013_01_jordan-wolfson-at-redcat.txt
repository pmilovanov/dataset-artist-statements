For his first solo exhibition in Los Angeles, New York-based artist Jordan Wolfson presents Raspberry Poser, an ambitious synthesis of digital video, computer-generated imagery (CGI) and hand-drawn animation. Employing materials culled from Internet image searches, the artist’s own lived experience and the histories of art and popular entertainment, Raspberry Poser touches upon and undermines the gravity of such pervasive themes as life, death and love. An assembly of found images, sampled music, commissioned animations and scenes filmed on location in Paris and New York are brought together in Raspberry Poser to consider the developments of digital and analog animation as essential to the histories of modernism and modernity, responsible for shaping and relaying the concerns of sculptural and pictorial modes of representation and defining our relationship to images and objects.
