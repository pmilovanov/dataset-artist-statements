Altman Siegel is pleased to present Soil Erosion, an exhibition curated by Shannon Ebner and featuring more than twenty artists. The original call for soil erosion sought to maneuver around its title. It spoke of states’ erosions, climate erosions, cultural erosions, and social erosions; soil as land, body, and soiling; erosion as eros, loss, and desire, and as potential for new clearings. Taken together, the works in Soil Erosion are a collection of such starting points, placed in a larger narrative field where meaning and the cultural and political circumstances of our living conditions transmute each other to cast doubt and shore up new certainties.
*Rirkrit Tiravanija’s work will be exhibited in the media room at Minnesota Street Project (1275 Minnesota Street) for the duration of the exhibition.
