The Institute of Contemporary Art (ICA) at the University of Pennsylvania is pleased to present The Freedom Principle: Experiments in Art and Music, 1965 to Now. This large-scale group exhibition links the vibrant legacy of avant-garde jazz and experimental music of the late 1960s (particularly within the African American arts scene on the South Side of Chicago) and its continuing influence on contemporary art and culture today.
The Freedom Principle: Experiments in Art and Music, 1965 to Now is organized by Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago.
