In the summer of 1969 Jef Geys decided to follow the Tour of France. A cycling enthusiast like so many of his countrymen, the Belgian artist photographed the stages of what was to be Eddy Merckx’s first victory of the Tour.
On this occasion he produced a series of photographs that juxtapose multiple i.e.sociological, geographical and artistic – realities.
The photographs put the riders on an equal footing with fans and onlookers. The logos and advertisements in the cities hosting a stage of the race constitute the symbolic literature of the event. The points of view are those of the amateur the true amateur who, through repetitive and rarely contented gestures, lacking the slightest aesthetic project and embodying the purest possible critical position, is a voyeur.
Exhibited for the first time nearly fifty years after they were taken, these sixty-seven black and white photographs hold a documentary and nostalgic value-without even taking into account the sharpness of Jef Gey’s work, who created « bolted » framing on the occasion.
