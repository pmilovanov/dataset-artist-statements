For the third time, Haus der Kunsts Capsule exhibitions give young, international emerging artists the opportunity to present new works. The Capsule format provides each artist with an autonomous exhibition space.
When encountering Sara MacKillops work, close attention to detail is recommended. MacKillop draws on office stationery such as pens, envelopes and fax paper, or employs modest materials such as cardboard boxes, wall paper and record sleeves. Although these ephemeral items are easily identifiable, the artist wittily and subtly interferes with their attributes and dimensions. The familiar, thereby, becomes unfamiliar, and the unremarkable becomes notable. MacKillops artist books of appropriated mail order catalogues and typewriter manuals, or restrained arrangements of colored pencils, disclose not only a sense of humor, but also point to the artists fascination with bureaucratic systems, seriality, and patterns, which she subtly erodes and interrupts – the eye skips a beat, much as a scratched vinyl record. It is with slight shifts and incremental changes that MacKillop manages to reveal poetry in the ordinary.
Sara MacKillop (b. 1973 in Bromley, UK) lives and works in London. She studied painting at the Royal College of Art, London.
