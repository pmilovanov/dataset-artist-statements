Almost nothing comes without a symptom or intervall. And depending on the situation and intention words like method, mania, praxis and canon push on to the stage in plain clothes. But no day comes without a temperament. We think of moods having a heart or stomach, rather than a tool in their right hand. But no, because everything becomes working and shaking hands in the evening.
