Gaga is pleased to present The hours of this Watch is Numbered, the second solo show of Swedish artist Karl Holmqvist in the gallery.
The title from the exhibition is a misquote from the already irregular phrase, The Days of this Society is Numbered used by fellow artist Rirkrit Tiravanija. The subject is time and the immanent end of time. In the gallery there are a neon sign, an oversized wine glass, an erased drawing, a basket with marble sugar cubes, a voice-over animation video, a number of wall drawings and their reference material in a vitrine. The works in their various media (all works 2012) are based on quotes and misquotes from a variety of artists, writers, where the gallery comes to form something like a 3d collage, a Gesamtkunstwerk for our time.
Karl Holmqvist began his career as a poet and performer, making readings of poetry from the early 1990s in exhibition venues all over the world. In 2006, Holmqvist first began to show sculptures and objects. His work deals with the phenomenology of time, language and perception, with references ranging from current music hits, to the Situationists and the Beat Generation. His mediums include light, language and text as well as collage, sculpture and animated video.
