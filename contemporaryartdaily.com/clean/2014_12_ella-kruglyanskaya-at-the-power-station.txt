The female figure has long been the focus of Ella Kruglyanskaya’s work. For “Grafika,” Kruglyanskaya presents a group of large and small scale works on paper that derive from sketches sampled from her own studio archive. The sketches are amplified in scale and in the subsequent mark making, take on a format and style that resemble over- sized print ephemera or quasi-advertisements devoid of branding. The exaggerated contours and graphic delineation of breasts and thighs play up the caricatured status of the figures’ compromised state of action and languid repose — never fully breaking free from the cartoonish scenarios or perceptions that manner and valorize them.
Yet, Kruglyanskaya’s myopic handling of the female figure sardonically tempers the work’s excessive sexuality with a flattened cartoon-like drafting style. Her work employs a bold color palette with thick contours of fastidious line- work that simplify to areas of concentrated detail, reducing fleshy volumes to a dense web of sketchy abstraction. The figure/ground relationships in the work are intentionally ambiguous and reflect Kruglyanskaya’s interdisciplinary reference points, which pair aspects of graphic design and book illustration with issues of female representation and display.
