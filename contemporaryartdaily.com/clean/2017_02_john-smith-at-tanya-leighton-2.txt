In celebration of the 40th anniversary of John Smiths film The Girl Chewing Gum, Tanya Leighton is pleased to announce an exhibition focusing on this seminal work, widely regarded as one of the most important avant-garde films of the 20th century. The exhibitions title, The Man Girl Phoning Chewing Mum Gum, is a conflation of the titles of the two films on view The Girl Chewing Gum, 1976 and The Man Phoning Mum, 2011. The latter repurposes the earlier film wholesale, building on its referent by overlaying video on the original. These two works both of the same length and sharing the same soundtrack are presented in synchronized loop.
John Smiths work has been widely shown internationally for four decades. He was the winner of the 2013 Jarman Award for achievement in artists filmmaking. His solo exhibitions in the past year include LOOK Gallery, Budapest; Kate MacGarry, London; Wolverhampton Art Gallery; Galerie für Zeitgenössische Kunst, Leipzig; Vita Kuben, Umea. Retrospective programmes of his work were presented recently at international film festivals in Leipzig, Munich, Lussas, Stuttgart and Vilnius.
