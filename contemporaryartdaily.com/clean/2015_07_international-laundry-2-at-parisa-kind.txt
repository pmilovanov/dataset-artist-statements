Galerie Parisa Kind is pleased to present International Laundry 2, a group exhibition organized by Mike Bouchet.
The subject matter of many artworks in this exhibition initially come across as familiar as their topics reflect on popular subjects.
There is a range of attitudes represented from the irreverent, to darkly humorous, to the violent and poetic, that these artistic responses are filtered through. Much of the work involves popular collective memory and marks a certain point of cultural time. The artists engage quite directly with their respective content, and do not attempt to establish decorative, esoteric, romantic or scientific positions. Instead, they deal with the authoritative aspect that these central images represent. Each unique approach culminates in something far more invigorating and meaningful than its original inspiration.
