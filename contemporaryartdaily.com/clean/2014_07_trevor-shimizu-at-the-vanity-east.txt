I was born in Santa Rosa, California, where Alfred Hitchcock filmed his masterpiece, Shadow of a Doubt. I grew up in a small town, Sebastopol, California, about ten minutes from Santa Rosa. Growing up wasn’t easy. I liked Molly Ringwald in The Breakfast Club, but found it unfortunate that she falls for the Judd Nelson character. I thought she should fall for Anthony Michael Hall, a character I could identify with. So I made this painting. Later in life, I aspired to be an actor. I was cast as a paparazzi for a Smash Mouth music video. Over the years, there were a couple other minor roles in music videos and a video by the artist, Josh Kline. Other than that, I haven’t done much with my acting career. —Trevor Shimizu
