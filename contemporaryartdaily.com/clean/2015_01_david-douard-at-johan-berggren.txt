Mind is fragmentsWhatever you can remember from last year’s Milk Magazine, this year bring the
bloodflow
in cells thru web arteries &amp; stairway
glands to typewriter consciousness
I’ll leave my body through unborn ears Not my language but a voice
chanting on the walls, my sick saliva
Parallels: always the same close-up In a thin motel
her naked breasts
the raw Aether
cool moonshine aftertaste, midnight Nostalgia
A healthy day in the snow, white breath Of Autumn leaves,
wind roar in bare ash arms, oak branch green Smoke thru wires
Radiostatic electric crackle from the center of communications: I broadcast thru Time,
wireless –
only an Instant, flows in the sink
