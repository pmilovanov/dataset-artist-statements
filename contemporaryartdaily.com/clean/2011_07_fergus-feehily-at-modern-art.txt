Modern Art is pleased to announce an exhibition of new paintings by Fergus Feehily. This will be Feehily’s first solo exhibition in London.
Fergus Feehily’s paintings share a collective sense of humility and sensitivity. His paintings are meticulously and imperfectly crafted, constructed from wood, paper, paint and fabric: materials that are sometimes found and sometimes made, and that always bring or suggest a story and particular tenor. Small in scale, Feehily’s work presents a situation of knowable, comprehendible reality that wears lightly the absorbed legacies of post-minimalism and formalism yet his work has no pretense to be or to be about either of those things. There is a character of reticence to his paintings, but that is a character balanced by a sense of affirmation and spirit of openness that delights in ordering and reordering a small part of the world.
Fergus Feehily was born in Dublin in 1968, and lives and works in Berlin. Feehily’s work is currently on view as the subject of a solo show at the Dallas Museum of Art, Dallas, USA; and in the group exhibition Twenty, Irish Museum of Modern Art, Dublin, Ireland. Recent solo exhibitions include Pavilion, The Douglas Hyde Gallery, Dublin, Ireland(2009); Makeshifts and Endpapers, Neuer Aachener Kunstverein, Aachen, Germany (2008); and Late Eighty-Six, The Return, Goethe Institute, Dublin, Ireland (2007).
