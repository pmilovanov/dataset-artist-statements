Whos Exploiting Who in the Deep Sea? brings together a selection of works by influential Kenyan-born, Germany-based artist Cosima von Bonin. This exhibition, the artists first in Canada, examines von Bonins ongoing fascination with the ocean, a theme that is commonly evoked in her works but rarely made explicit.
The opposing forces of the sea—both a mysterious underworld and a site of sun-seeking vacationers—operate as a metaphor throughout much of von Bonins practice, manifested here through a collection of works from the past ten years. Ranging from sculptures of creatures like crabs and sharks to a larger-than-life bikini, von Bonins cast of characters present a host of contradictions. They are at once approachable and not quite what they seem.
This motley crew echoes von Bonins own band of collaborators. Frequently working with friends and colleagues, von Bonin has long eschewed the authorial role of the artist, prioritizing delegation as readily as creation. Drawing on the expertise of musicians, performers and fellow artists, von Bonins work mixes art history, popular culture and the absurd to offer up wry critiques of contemporary life and its many mysteries. Appropriately, the deep sea—where von Bonins creatures venture—is its own universe, remote and little known to us.

Diviniti, Mary Messhausen, produzentin and Simone Junker will perform throughout the opening on March 26th.
Cosima von Bonin: Whos Exploiting Who in the Deep Sea? is co-curated by SculptureCenter Curator Ruba Katrib and Glasgow International Director Sarah McCrory. The exhibition is organized by Glasgow International and SculptureCenter, New York.
