Van Yetter presents new paintings hinting towards themes that range from domestic abuse to the Mexican drug cartel. Throughout the exhibition, 12 works line the walls. Disrupting this flow of variegated painting, a black wall displays two works of identical format rendered in white paint on black paper. An ambience of erie twilight pervades both. A scene of disquieting isolation: a figure wanders at the horizon; a snake and a skull symbolically hark back to death and original sin.
In the adjacent work two men peer into an terrarium. Again, a snake is set in the foreground. The same dramatic atmosphere prevails. One of the figures is sticking his tongue out both mimicking and mocking the snake. The scene is viewed from the vantage point of within the terrarium. As the show may be interpreted as an allusive story that shifts focus rapidly, this black wall emerges as the final chapter, one that realigns each previous subject into a scope of personal reflection.
