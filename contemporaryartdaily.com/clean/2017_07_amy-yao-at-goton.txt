Foreign Investments. Construction tarps
Cuteness blinds
Whose investments for whom.
Non-Vessel.
I am not your vessel I am in your face.
My Interior
SURPRISE!
A portrait of Los Angeles.
Mono-scape of 2016 going into 2017
Erase your mind, memories
And replace them with dreams or subway tile Decomposed granite, succulents and pottery.
