Evidence is often far from evident. Only after a careful (even obsessive) process of observing, collecting, and cataloguing does an object that seems to be inconsequential prove to be far from it.
Candy Jernigans drawings, sculptures, and collages tell the story of a life spent turning details into evidence, and, by extension, into poetic pieces of social commentary. This exhibition focuses on her works on paper, ranging from 1980 to 1991. There are drawings of bottle caps,bugs, and leaves. There are drawings of luggage tags, cigarette packs,and Cheez Doodles. And there are many drawings of vases and vessels,the last body of work she made.
Candy Jernigan (1952â€”1991) was born in Miami and lived in New York.
Curated by Anthony Huberman and organized by Leila Grothe with assistance from Magdalena Hartelova.
