Image Employment presents recent moving image works that investigate various modes of contemporary production. The selected works illustrate differing approaches to the subject, from observational films that avoid participation in capitalistic image creation, to videos that engage corporate omnipotence by employing its processes, as well as works that complicate these two tendencies.
Many of the films in the exhibition take an oppositional approach to commercial image making. In Kevin Jerome Eversons Quality Control African-American workers from an Alabama dry-cleaning factory are shown relentlessly carrying out their jobs in real time. Everson explores the duration and physicality of labor through a series of lengthy shots that draw attention to particular tasks such as working the pant press or ironing shirts.
Alternately, many video works in this exhibition employ corporate processes and communication by reiterating corporate imagery and intervening into sites of emergent industries and globalized consumption. DIS Watermarked I Kenzo Fall 2012, for example, arose out of a paid commission for Kenzos seasonal menswear collection. The work reflexively dramatizes the commercial advertisement form through the absurd excesses of the actors expressions, the politically correct racial composition, and a stock media infused aesthetic.
Invoking the growing convergence between labor, consumption, and that which propels them, Image Employment examines different ways artists use moving image work to engage and confront contemporary modes of production.
A screening schedule is available here.
