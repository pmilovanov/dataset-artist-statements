In celebration of 18 years of Murray Guy, we announce an exhibition with many of the artists whose work we have presented, with whom we have collaborated, and who have inspired us throughout this time.

This will be Murray Guys final exhibition. It will be on view from Tuesday January 10th through Saturday February 4th with a closing reception 5â€“9PM.
As we begin a new year, we look forward to future projects and conversations with the artists of the gallery, as well as with the colleagues, curators, collectors, and writers, whose enthusiasm and camaraderie has sustained and encouraged us over the years.
We will be continuing to work with the artists on current and upcoming exhibitions and can be reached by email as usual. As our separate plans advance they will be announced.
We look forward to seeing you all soon!
Janice Guy and Margaret Murray
