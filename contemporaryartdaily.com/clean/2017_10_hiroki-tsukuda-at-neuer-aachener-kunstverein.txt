NAK Neuer Aachener Kunstverein presents the first institutional solo exhibition Hour of Excavation by Hiroki Tsukuda.
Referring to cineastic archetypes the title of the exhibition specifies a concrete moment as well as a precise task and therein delivers a clue to the understanding of Japanese artist Hiroki Tsukuda’s works. Hence Tsukuda can be see as a archaeologist of images. Layer by layer the artist frees his own imaginary pictorial world. These worlds only exist in Tsukuda’s fantasy at first, but are assembled by digital technology and brought to paper in ink and charcoal.
In the complex and aesthetically highly appealing large-sized panoramic views straight architectural structures meet organic forms and preposterous signs in multiple perspectives. The resulting allegedly chaotic construct of different planes is traced in downright archeological precision and such nature, human beings and architecture exist in this scenarios simultaneously and ultimately melt into each other. In this manner Tsukuda deforms and reconstructs our modernist world. The artist understands his visions not as a look towards the future, but as a view into a parallel world, composed by past, present and future.
Furthermore Hiroki Tsukuda creates three-dimensional installations. For this purpose the artist uses collected, found or common building materials, which conjoin to neo-futuristic topographies in the exhibition room. Furthermore for the NAK Neuen Aachener Kunstverein Tsukuda left the exhibition space of the building and brought his installation into the surrounding park area.
Hiroki Tsukuda was born in 1978 in Kagawa, Japan. He studied at the Department of Imaging Arts and Sciences at Musashino Art University in Tokyo. Tsukuda lives and works Tokyo.
