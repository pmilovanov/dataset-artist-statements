“Gemüt mit Hinterhof” (“Soul with a backyard”) deals with different impressive aesthetic effects based on post-digital handmade procedures. Light from behind supports the feeling of a huge public flat screen. Even though these surfaces seem to be done by luxury photoshop plugins, there’s not one pixel involved. A few loose lines create a diary atmosphere with their prosaic poetry sound like: “Already after the third bite you got 3000 flight miles in your mouth.” or “A person with my name gives me food, finally.” In addition there are posted some little A4 poster on the window glass placed there by someone else with basic open message intentions: “The silence between will and pill.”
