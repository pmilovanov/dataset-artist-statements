Frank Walter, self-styled 7th Prince of the West Indies, Lord of Follies and the Ding-a-Ding Nook, was born and lived in Antigua. He spent the last twenty-five years of his life in an isolated shack on a hillside, surrounded by his writings, some 25,000 typed pages of history, philosophy, and autobiography, and by the extraordinary paintings and carvings for which he is now remembered.
His pictures include figurative scenes, landscapes, abstract compositions, and real and imaginary portraits. They were painted with immediacy and spontaneity on a variety of materials.
