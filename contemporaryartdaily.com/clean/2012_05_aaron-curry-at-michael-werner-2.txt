Michael Werner Gallery is pleased to present Buzz Kill, an exhibition of new works by Aaron Curry. Buzz Kill is Aaron Curry’s second exhibition at Michael Werner Gallery, New York, and his most ambitious exhibition to date. A monumental sculpture forms the centerpiece of Buzz Kill: extending from the four corners of the gallery, and reaching from the floor to the ceiling, this massive painted aluminum sculpture divides the exhibition space into individual “rooms” through which viewers can move. Buzz Kill is accompanied by a fully illustrated catalogue.
