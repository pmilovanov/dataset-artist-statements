In her unique way, Raphaela Vogel (b. 1988, Nuremberg) knows how to splice individual, interpersonal conflicts with the intraindividual challenges of modern society. In her videos, installations and performances, this is frequently expressed in terms of the confrontation between two competing worlds, the patent contradictoriness of which is clearer to us today than ever before: corporeality and technology. To achieve this, she uses the latest digital technology and gadgets; however, rather than disguise this fact, she actively incorporates it and them into her work as protagonists. At the same time, she makes use of animal, natural and seemingly archaic materials that lend her installations a flavour of the relic. Raphaela Vogel combats the dominant male view of things, which not only continues to determine our everyday world, but also holds sway in art (history). She does this by torpedoing the classical subject/object relationship. Most of her videos are made using minicams attached to drones. This allows Vogel to film completely on her own and be simultaneously both viewer and the object of view. Control replaces the loss of control.
In her show at the Westfälischer Kunstverein, Raphaela Vogel presents two new “video sculptures” as she calls them, along with a number of other works. Her exhibition will be accompanied by a catalogue in 2017 to be published in conjunction with the Motorenhalle Dresden.

Raphaela Vogel studied fine art at the Nuremberg Academy of Art and at the Städelschule in Frankfurt. She also undertook postgraduate study at De Ateliers in Amsterdam. Raphaela Vogel lives and works in Berlin.
