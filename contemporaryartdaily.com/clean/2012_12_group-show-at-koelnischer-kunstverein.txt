The three artists will set their very different artistic practices in relation to one another and combine painting, film and conceptual art in a joint exhibition design. A recurring motif of the exhibition will be the exploration of the relations between references of content in the respective artistic production and the dramaturgic as well as stylistic means of their staging. A characteristic feature of the artists work is the investigative and inquiring approach they take to the material they work with, and its respective dispositions, linked with a particularly strong assertion and examination of the visual. In their work, visuality manifests itself as an instrument of association and emotion which – perhaps because of its particular ambivalence and the room for interpretation it leaves – is congenial to reflecting on different cultural spheres of life and knowledge.
