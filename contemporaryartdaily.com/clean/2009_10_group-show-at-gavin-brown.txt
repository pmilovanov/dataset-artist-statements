Gavin Brown’s enterprise is pleased to present an exhibition of three young European artists: Ida Ekblad, Alistair Frost, and David Hominal. While all three have shown widely in Europe, they are relatively new to American audiences, thus presenting a unique opportunity to view their work.
Ida Ekblad (b. 1980) lives and works in Oslo, Norway. She works in a variety of media including sculpture, painting, photography, and collage. She is one of the founders of Willy Wonka Inc., an artist-run space in Oslo, and in 2009 has shown in a number of exhibitions including solo shows at New Jerseyy, Basel and Gaudel de Stampa, Paris; and featured in Younger than Jesus: The Generational at the New Museum, New York.
Alistair Frost (b. 1981) lives and works in Amsterdam and London. His work evolves out of linguistic game play, visual problem solving, and word association to generate groupings of signs and systems. He received his MA in painting from the Royal College of Art, London and has recently shown at Galerie Micky Schubert, Berlin; Dicksmith Gallery, London, and CANADA Gallery, New York.
David Hominal (b. 1976) lives and works in Amsterdam. His practice involves paintings, drawings, collages, and sculptures that investigate traditional forms, often utilizing painted text and abstract gestures. He has recently been featured in a number of exhibitions throughout Europe, including solo shows at Office Baroque, Antwerp, and Centre d’Art Contemporain in Geneva. This will be Hominal’s first gallery exhibition in the United States.
