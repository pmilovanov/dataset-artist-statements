Tommaso Corvi-Mora is pleased to present an exhibition of new work by Colter Jacobsen, his third at the gallery. The exhibition will include new works on paper and a site-specific work.
Your smile is a ham- 
Mock Ill take a nap
 In. Palm 
Trees on fire leanin
 In on me. 
Two Rip 
Van Winkles share
The same beard sleep- 
In
 For a hundred years. 
The half-do-
 me was once
A whole-dome
Worn glacially.
In the quick 
Ness of the dusk in 
The quickness of 
The dusk
There is a light 
I only see you
 in.
