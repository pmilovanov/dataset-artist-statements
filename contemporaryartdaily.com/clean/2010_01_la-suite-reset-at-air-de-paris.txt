Before finishing up with LA SUITE, we have to convince ourselves weve finished with it. Have to start again from scratch, knowing its not really possible. Do a reset before the real end of LA SUITE. And consider the work of art as at once succession, follow-through and sequel. Then well be able to go on popping the top off a good bottle of wine (some Tout va bien), swapping American series, getting ready for the next art fair â€“ all of which we hadnt ever stopped doing anyway. Following up and on and through with not a worry in the world.
