Positive affirmations are ideas or beliefs that you can repeat either internally or aloud. The short-term goal is to impress your subconscious with motivational thought. Through interminable repetition, the long- term goal is to let positive thought encourage positive lifestyle. For the affirming statement-as- meditation to be effective, it should not only be recited mentally but ideally, you should also be able to see itâ€”in the form of text or imagery; Post-It-Notes on the mirror, or a photo of a sunset on the dashboard of your car.
A possible side effect of this repetitive practice, where there is a lack of results: vehement disbelief in all things good.
