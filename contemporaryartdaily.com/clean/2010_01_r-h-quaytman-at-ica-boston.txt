Boston-born artist R.H. Quaytman incorporates optical abstractions, silkscreened photographs, diamond dust layers, and hand-painted trompe l’oeil elements into her works. Using these diverse techniques, she weaves personal, art historical, and formal narratives to explore the many contexts in which painting can be seen and understood. Presented in groups she considers “chapters,” Quaytmans works invite the viewer to look from one painting to another, considering individual works within the context of the group.
For Momentum 15, her first solo museum exhibition, Quaytman will create new paintings inspired by the past exhibitions and educational mission of the ICA, its history of presenting the contemporary, and the architecture of the Momentum gallery.
