The work of Paris-based Canadian artist Zin Taylor probes the spaces between object and idea, form and thought. Taylors work imagines the mind as a studio or a factory, where hazy and nebulous thoughts grow organically into abstract vocabularies of contour and curve. Language is central to his work, not as a means to explain, communicate or inform, but rather to speculate, negotiate and discuss.
For his exhibition at Oakville Galleries in Gairloch Gardens, Taylor employs familiar visual cues to continue these investigations, locating moments in which the intangible—sound, ideology, thought—finds articulation in aesthetic material and form. The exhibition brings together several separate bodies of work or “units, including a grouping of sculptural body-form torsos that reference and invert the material language of Auguste Rodin; a mobile that draws inspiration from the alphabet-like hanging structures of Alexander Calder; and a wall drawing that stretches throughout the gallery.
