We are very pleased to present now in Düsseldorf a comprehensive exhibition with works of Bernd and Hilla Becher.
Fascinated by the functional buildings of the coal and mining industry and the immense variety of shapes of winding towers, blast furnaces, gas tanks, cooling and water towers Bernd and Hilla Becher started at the beginning of the 60s to preserve these objects in b/w photographs. Today grown to an impressive oeuvre the aim of their project was already 1969 nothing less than to produce an almost complete chain of the different phenotypes.“ On their travels through Europe and United States’ they created a unique morphological compendium.
To ensure the perceptibility of the various characteristics and their comparability, the Bechers developed general systematics early in their works. On their b/w photographs the objects are isolated from their environment, placed central and format filling and avoid all dramatic effects. Today, the Becher’s approach aiming to objectivity, refers to the authorship.
The Ruhr Aera, once starting point of the work of Bernd and Hilla Becher, is 2010 the European Capital of Culture. Several projects will show works of Bernd and Hilla Becher. From February 2 to May 2 2010 the Joseph Albers Museum Quadrat in Bottrop will dedicate a comprehensive exhibition to their body of work Mines and Foundries.
