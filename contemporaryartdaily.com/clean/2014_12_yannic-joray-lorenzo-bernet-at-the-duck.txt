The works by the two artists are installed on two distinct levels. The room is horizontally split in two. Not much is to be seen at eye level. Thus with the things out of reach, the visitor can either look up, or look down on something. The metal baskets on poles (Bernet) and miniature camp fires (Joray) suggest a collectively shared narrative. The exhibition offers a panorama when viewed as a whole.
