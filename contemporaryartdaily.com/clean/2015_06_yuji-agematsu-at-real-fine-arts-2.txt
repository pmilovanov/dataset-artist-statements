Real Fine Arts is pleased to present an exhibition of a new work by Yuji Agematsu. This is Agematsu’s second solo project at the gallery.
The exhibition’s single, multi-part sculpture 01-01-2014 12-31-2014 is comprised of 365 cellophane wrappers from cigarette packs arranged on shelving units throughout the gallery. For over 25 years Agematsu has filled a cellophane wrapper per day with detritus collected on walks through the streets of New York. The cellophanes in the exhibition are grouped together into the 12 months of 2014, each small, vitrine-like element calendaring the ebb and flow of the city’s discarded material.
Yuji Agematsu was born in Japan and has lived and worked in New York since 1980. Agematsu’s Walk on A, B, C, a solo project commissioned by the Whitney Museum to coincide with their reopening, was composed of a slide installation surveying the museum’s new building and it’s surroundings. Other recent solo exhibitions include Yale Union, Portland, OR and Artspeak, Vancouver, both in 2014. Recent group exhibitions include Crossing Brooklyn: Art from Bushwick, Bed- Stuy, and Beyond, Brooklyn Museum of Art, Brooklyn, 2014; Warm Side of Zero, Overduin &amp; Co., Los Angeles, 2014; Reckless Head, Michael Benevento, Los Angeles, 2013; and Looking Back / The 7th White Columns Annual, White Columns, New York, 2013.
