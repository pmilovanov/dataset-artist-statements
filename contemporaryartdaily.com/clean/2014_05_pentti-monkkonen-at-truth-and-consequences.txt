C.R.E.A.M. is a prolongation of F.I.L.T.H. opening few days before at the ‘Hacienda’ in Zurich. Both exhibitions will be showing for the first time the “Box Truck” paintings series by Pentti Monkonnen.
Imagine a Box Trucks’ fleet inseminating a city by propagating images. Its different territory identities slip into the unspoken, the imaginary, the real of unconsciousness. An easily recognizable craft specific to the north has been circulating from west to east and west to south and north and south and to westOur minds are being softly subdued by this incessant circulation of signs, whose flow spread over the cities. The more we want the more we get infected. Without knowing it we’ve been playing it for a long time. C.R.E.A.M., don’t you stop. Let’s buy some time.
Pentti Monkonnen is a key player of the Los Angeles art scene. He opened with his wife, Liz Craft, 2 years ago a gallery in Venice CA and organize early this year an Art Fair in The Paramount Ranch.
