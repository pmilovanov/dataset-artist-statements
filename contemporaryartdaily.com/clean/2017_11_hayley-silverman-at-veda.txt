Silverman’s installation consists of a mythic tableau in glass, developed for the unique architecture of the space. Two translucent angel marionettes hang on either side of an illuminated bird in flight, pierced by an arrow. This blown-glass scene floats in front of an abstract landscape painted on the back gallery wall. The work is visible both day and night.
The title and exhibition, The Living Watch Over the Living, advance the artist’s research on technological and spiritual mediums as creative instruments in recording one’s life. Silverman’s secular reading of angels across Abrahamic traditions draws parallels between heavenly observation and pervasive sensing, otherwise known as big data.
