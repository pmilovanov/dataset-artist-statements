The title of Andreas Slominski’s current exhibition at Galerie Bärbel Grässlin begins with the first letter of his first name and ends with ski, the last syllable of his family name, which reflects a sportive attitude. One could expect, then, that the exhibition shows what happens – or has happened –between A and ski. Whether this expectation is satisfied or not remains open, as what the audience finds on view are garage doors.
The outside of the door faces the wall which means that viewers look at its inside, the side which forms the fourth wall of the garage. Garage doors close garages in the same way that eyelids close eyes. When the door is open you have a fresh view out into the world and the inside of the garage door becomes a ceiling painting. But what happens in the garage when it remains closed? The garage is the place where both creative and uncreative people pursue their hobbies, bands rehearse, developers develop and inventors invent. The stories of fantastic companies such as Disney, Porsche, Hewlett-Packard, Apple, Microsoft and not lastly the family company Grässlin Zeitschalttechnik started behind closed garage doors.
However, the insides of Slominskis garage doors are prospective, not real, witnesses to (un)creative leisure-time activities or the resourceful spirit of innovation. They entice us with their clever rhetoric which invites speculation. For these doors are brand-new and allow us to conjecture about what could have happened and what will happen.
