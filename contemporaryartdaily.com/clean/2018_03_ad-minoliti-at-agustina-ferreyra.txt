The work of Ad Minoliti (Buenos Aires, 1980) is concerned with the relation between eroticism, queer theory, history and geometry; as well as the anthropological importance and social implications of design. For the artist, geometry is the best tool to represent and investigate a trans-human utopia and heterotopia in which gender theories can be applied to the pictorial language, giving way to new possibilities in which we can experiment and redesign the visual world. Through a wide variety of mediums and expressions, such as painting, installation, sculpture, video and fashion, Minoliti aims to debunk fixed ideas about gender through aesthetic confrontation, while commenting on gender conditions, roles and relations.
In this new series of paintings, developed for the show in collaboration with her mother Cecilia, Minoliti explores the celebrated and often idealized relationship between an artist father and his children, reverting the patriarchal discourse in which motherhood tends to be erased from any creative process, while addressing abstraction and geometry through a maternal, intimate and feminist lens.
