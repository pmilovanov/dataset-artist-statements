greengrassi is pleased to announce Moyra Daveys second solo exhibition at the gallery. The artist will present three mailer pieces, one comprising 90 elements. For these methodical projects, Davey folds c-prints, addresses them and sends them by post to friends, family and collaborators around the world. The show will also include her new 28-minute film Notes on Blue (2015) commissioned by The Walker Art Center in Minneapolis. Braiding together disparate observations and personal accounts, Notes on Blue is an episodic meditation on blindness, color, and the life and work of British filmmaker, gardener and political activist Derek Jarman (1942–1994).
Moyra Davey was born in Canada in 1958 and currently lives and works in New York. Recent solo shows include MUMOK, Vienna; ICA, Philadelphia; Camden Art Centre (2014); Tate, Liverpool; Presentation House Gallery, Vancouver (2013) and Kunsthalle, Basel (2010). Her works were recently featured in Photo Poetics at Kunsthalle, Berlin; Take One: Contemporary Photographs at Philadelphia Museum of Art, Philadelphia (2015); CODEX at CCA Wattis Institute for Contemporary Art, San Francisco (2014); Minimal Resistance at Museo Reina Sofia, Madrid; Limage papillon at MUDAM, Luxembourg (2013); XXX Bienal de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo; Whitney Biennial, New York (2012) and New Photography 2011 at MoMA, New York (2011), among others. She was part of the collective that started the New York artist-run gallery Orchard (2005-2008). Davey is a 2004–2005 recipient of an Anonymous Was a Woman Award.
