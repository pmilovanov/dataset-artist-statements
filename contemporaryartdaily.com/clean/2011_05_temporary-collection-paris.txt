TEMPORARY COLLECTION is a collection and an exhibition.
TEMPORARY COLLECTION relies on private connections and personal links.
TEMPORARY COLLECTION travels and takes place in different countries.

TEMPORARY COLLECTION is a nomadic collection that articulates itself at every location; it adapts, keeps works from former presentations while integrating new ones.
TEMPORARY COLLECTION is diluted and reconstituted after every presentation.

TEMPORARY COLLECTION attempts to mediate the formulation of artworks in their relation to specific locations, to reveal working processes and dialogues. The assembling and bringing works into relation with each other provokes alterations through the changing of locations. These alterations are the origin and essence of TEMPORARY COLLECTION.
