The exhibition NO MORE WAR is the first extensive presentation of Keiichi Tanaamis (*1936) sculptures from the 1980’s. During this time he experimented with traditional Japanese craftsmanship, originally used for wooden toy puzzles. The colourful sculptures remind of postmodern design objects, architecture models, toys or creatures from science fiction movies.
Keiichi Tanaamis practice is of high influence for the development of Pop Art in Japan. He’s a predecessor for many Japanese artists such as Takashi Murakami or Tabaimo. Tanaami studied graphic design and created various record covers. He worked with Ushio Shinara, the leader of the Japanese Neo-Dada-movement as well as Robert Rauschenberg and Michel Tapié during their visits in Japan. In 1969 Tanaami travelled to the USA where he met with Andy Warhol and visited his factory. In 1975 Tanaami became the first Art Director of the Japanese Playboy magazine. Since 1991 he teaches at the art school in Kyoto. He lives and works in Tokyo.
