Cultural-historical, philosophical and scientific references can be found in the artworks of Alicja Kwade. By transforming various everyday objects such as clocks, lamps and mirrors into significant and thought-provoking arrangements, she reflects on the complex relationships between capital and production as well as abstract values such as time and money. Minimal changes in state run through her entire work and point to topics such as temporality and stasis.




The spectacular light and sound installation Nach Osten, which she realized in 2013 in the monumental St. Agnes Church in Berlin, is based on the principle of the Foucault pendulum, a direct visual proof of the earth’s rotation. This historical experiment as the point of departure for her sculptural inquiry is translated into an impressive sensory experience in the finished artwork.
The artist will recreate and install this spectacular work, which was only exhibited for three days at the St. Agnes Church in Berlin, at the Kunstmuseum St. Gallen, in the Oberlichtsaal.
Alicja Kwade was born in 1979. She lives and works in Berlin. Her work has been shown in numerous institutions in recent years, including the Haus Esters in Krefeld in 2013 and the group exhibition Made in Germany II at the Kunstverein Hannover in 2012. The exhibition in St. Gallen was produced in cooperation with the Kunsthalle Nürnberg.
