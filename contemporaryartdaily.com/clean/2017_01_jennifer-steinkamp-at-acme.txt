ACME. is pleased to present Still-Life, a solo exhibition of new work by Los Angeles based artist Jennifer Steinkamp. This is the artists eleventh solo show at ACME., and the inaugural exhibition at the gallerys new Los Angeles location (see directions below). Steinkamp continues to employ computer animation and new media in order to explore ideas about architectural space, motion, and perception. In her latest series, the artist depicts a variety of female fruit bearing plants. Tempted by the idea of making a still-life, Steinkamp addresses the wryly taboo subject.

Denver, CO) studied Motion Graphics at the California Institute of the Arts, Valencia, CA, and received her BFA, MFA, and honorary PhD from Art Center College of Design, Pasadena, CA.
