Nicole Wermers works target the suggestive appeal of surfaces and the adaptation of a familiar fine-art aesthetic within the overall design of our daily life. Ashtrays resembling sculptures or sculptures that remind one of security devices at the exit of department stores blur the distinctions between functional design and autonomously conceived art. The works she has devised for her exhibition in the Kunstverein also fall into this category.
