Galerie Gisela Capitain is pleased to announce its sixth solo exhibition of new works by Charline von Heyl.
Charline von Heyls images evolve from within themselves, unfolding in an endless chain of experiments and reactions which exploit the possibilities of painting. Each painting is the result of an individual – partially unpredicted – development, that follows the mediums intrinsic laws, which vary from picture to picture. At times, overpainted sections may remain as shimmering ghostlike forms. The images, which exhibit a collage like layering, fluctuate somewhere between the painterly and the graphic. At the same time, they develop a spatial depth out of their two-dimensionality, where in-between spaces thrust forward like in a picture puzzle.
Over the course of time, Charline von Heyl has developed her own expanding repertoire of forms and patterns which are recognizable as recurring elements. Von Heyl playfully combines art historical and American pop cultural references, while adding them to her personal repertoire of forms in unexpected ways. Nonetheless, each image represents a universe of mysterious origins.
Good paintings have this tantalizing quality. And once you turn around, you absolutely cannot recapture them. They leave a hole in the mind, a longing.
