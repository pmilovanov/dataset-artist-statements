The fourth season was dedicated to Rosemarie Trockel. We began in February with a screening and a talk by Beatrix Ruf; then hosted a three-week Cine-Club with films by Brakhage, Pasolini, De Palma, and Fassbinder; then invited people to spend time sitting in front of a photograph by Trockel; then heard Susan Howe on Emily Dickinson; then Dorion Sagan on animal perception (via Jakob von Uexk√ºll); then saw a performance by LLILW GRAY (aka Keith Connolly); then invited Brigid Doherty to talk about headlessness; then showed videos by Judith Hopf and Molly McFadden; then finished by asking Douglas Ross to tell some stories. Thank you.
