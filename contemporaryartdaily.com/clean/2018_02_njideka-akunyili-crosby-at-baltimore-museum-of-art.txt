Los Angeles-based artist and 2017 MacArthur Genius Fellow Njideka Akunyili Crosby debuts a suite of new paintings that draw upon her experience of moving from Nigeria to the United States, maintaining ties to her family in Nigeria, and building relationships in America. Layers of paint, fabric, and photographic transfers not only energize the interiors and figures depicted in the artist’s works, but serve as a metaphor for the complex merging of relationships and cultural backgrounds that contribute to Akunyili Crosby’s sense of self.
This exhibition is curated by Senior Curator of Contemporary Art Kristen Hileman.
