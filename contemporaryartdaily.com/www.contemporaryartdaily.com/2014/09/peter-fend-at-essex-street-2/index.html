Remember: every country has a flag: every flag represents, in high abstraction, that country’s place.  But each place, as we learned from Earth Art and Duchamp’s Urinal, has a slope to something more essential to us all:  the Sea.  We revise the flags in relation to the Sea.

In response to tribulations with Documenta, the artist decided in 1992, when invited a second time, to replace the official flags of the three-month public event with his own.  These flags would not be without reason.  But they would also be challenging the current power setups.  Some thought of them as a joke.  No: they could become programs for future evolution of every site re-flagged.  Recall that a flag is specific to a place, so it becomes a highly-abstracted landscape painting of that place.  What is to be done, place by place, to address planet problems? The first flags identified programs for Germany, the EU, the Northern Hemisphere Americas, Asia and the Southern Hemisphere.  Next came flags for the UN, centered on the South Pole and not the North, and Switzerland, purchased by Zurich City’s wastewater (water runoff) administration.  In 2007, in another spurt, flags were produced for:  Libya, Cuba, Poland, France, Italy, Spain, Portugal, South Africa, China.  The last flag was flown large size outdoors in Shanghai—and remains an enduring proposal for that country’s now-controversial expansion into the Sea.

These flags, in 2014, present solutions, place by place, to global problems.

NOT PRESENTED, BUT ALWAYS POSSIBLE, IS THE FLAG OF THE UNITED STATES.

This flag is a landscape-painting.  It represents, in very abstract form, the 13 original colonies, as stripes, and the current number of states, as stars.  Each has a representative location.  I have applied my usual Duchamp-Urinal model to the US, to identify some 60 or so catchments into which waters and nutrients flow. To register this as a US flag requires a very-small modification:  instead of 50 stars, place 60, or maybe 63.  Probably no one but a US citizen, indoctrinated in the US flag from childhood, could have imagined the works here shown." aria-describedby="gallery-1-129449" /></a>

Aid programs to Haiti usually fail, with a few exceptions, such as that of doctors from Cuba. One could better begin with assessment of its soil. Materially, this soil starts in the red area, above sea level, then is cropped, burned and washed away, with residues flowing into the blue area, below sea level.  SAVE YOUR SOIL, I say.  Collect it from the sea, in the biological forms of seaweed and fish.  I&#8217;ve discussed this for decades with Haitian-Americans in NY (even Jean-Michel Basquiat; days before he died, he asked for a Haiti map; I produced it long after). If one concentrates more on the land-sea relation, and more on what flows down from that mountain ridge on the right to the territorial waters, then one can be more &#8220;humane&#8221; with the people living there.</p>

<p><em>Press Release:</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: courier, serif;">PETER FEND INVENTED THE<br />
FORM OF WRITING A WHOLE<br />
PLANET COULD DO FURTHER</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: courier, serif;">BECAUSE IT DERIVES FROM<br />
THE NATURE OF ALPHABETS</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: courier, serif;">NOT AN AIM TO BE ON TOP</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: courier, serif;">SIGNS TALK DOWN BUT THE<br />
WORD STACKS AGGLOMERATE</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: courier, serif;">THEY BUBBLE UP FROM ANY<br />
PERSON WITH AN ALPHABET<br />
TRAINING FROM CHILDHOOD</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: courier, serif;">DEMOCRACY HAS NEW POWER</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: courier, serif;">WORD STACKS WILL SPREAD</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: courier, serif;">AS A WAY TO COMMUNICATE<br />
AND ESTABLISH COMMUNITY</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: courier, serif;">AND, THEY ARE EASIER TO<br />
READ THAN THE PARAGRAPH</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: courier, serif;">BECAUSE THEY ARE GRAPHS</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: courier, serif;">NOT PARA-GRAPHS BUT THE<br />
REAL GRAPH, AS A LAYOUT</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: courier, serif;">SPATIAL LOGIC ORGANIZES<br />
VISUAL LANGUAGE WITH AN<br />
ART THAT INTEGRATES ALL<br />
AROUND US: ARCHITECTURE</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: courier, serif;">LITERARY INVENTION WILL<br />
COME FROM ARCHITECTURAL<br />
HABITS OF THOUGHT TODAY</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: courier, serif;">HOW CAN THE CIA CONTROL<br />
SUCH A NEW WAY TO WRITE</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: courier, serif;">FINALLY JAMES BOND MUST<br />
RELENT, GIVING WAY TO A<br />
FORCE OF COMMON THOUGHT</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: courier, serif;">BY A CITIZEN NAMED FEND</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
