<p>PICTURES IN THE PLACE OF OTHERS<br />
things thought while looking at<br />
Wolfgang Tillmans&#8217;s new work<br />
<em>&#8211; Dominic Eichler</em></p>
<p>In a wind blown Norwegian museum, a specialist in photography  conservation working on 19th Century prints recording a solar eclipse  turns to a group of journalists, many clutching impressive digital  cameras. Rueful, he reminds the company that if a pile of prints and a  stack of hard-drives packed with image data were left side-by-side in a  room, and then the electricity went out and many years were to pass,  that it is highly probable that only some of the paper prints would  survive and none of the data. Feet shuffle awkwardly as that apocalyptic  information sinks in, especially because we still mix up pictures with  memories. It seems ironic that even though we know this, or ought to,  that we don&#8217;t make prints and trust our disorganized data like  ourselves. The vanitas theme expressed through loose, day-lit fruit or  the fragile expressions of a small group of close friends and muses, has  been a constant trope of Wolfgang Tillmans&#8217;s photographic work over the  last two decades. In this period arguably our relationship to the  photographic image has changed forever, while Tillmans&#8217;s work has shown  remarkable constancy and led the way for many.</p>
<p>During eyes-open, waking hours, evidently a large slab of our brains is  busy processing images whether we want it to or not. Perhaps for that  internally exhausting reason most people secretly think that they are on  top of the picture game, that not only do they know a good picture when  they see one but if they had the time, they could also make one if they  wanted to. It doesn&#8217;t seem to matter that evidence to the contrary is  everywhere. Actually we remain ignorant, gullible and easily manipulated  when it comes to pictures and weirdly &#8216;less and less impressed by  impressive pictures&#8217;, as Tillmans observed to me. For his part though,  he wants it to be possible to trust his pictures, which perhaps seems  like a tall order getting taller, but that&#8217;s still what he hopes or  works at making possible.</p>
<p>The digitization of the image world has cemented this egoistic fantasy  of picture mastery and added another dimension because in the uploaded  world, next to scraps of text, pictures are the essence of virtual  existence. Given the drama of this situation, the limitless production  and distribution of an arsenal of personal pictures has come to be  considered a right, something which makes pictures as ubiquitous but  also as necessary as air. Generally, we are just as blasé about pictures  as air and in truth don&#8217;t really bother with looking and even when we  do, we do it without much attention to detail or understanding of really  what makes what we are looking at tick. Art suggests that when we do  that we deny ourselves both knowledge and pleasure.  Tillmans&#8217;s pictures  have never denied either the highly subjective or personal on one hand  or the enrichment of the experience of looking through art on the other.  His unapologetic attachment to colour and colour combinations is one  example of this. Bring on those sapphire blues and golden yellows, those  overly demanding greens, says his work &#8211; maybe it doesn&#8217;t even matter  on who or what they are found.</p>
<p>This text accompanies a new solo exhibition of his work, which at the  time of writing, has no title. The confronting, intense constellation of  pictures Tillmans has chosen for this exhibition have &#8211; in a classic  sense of how artists used to work and galleries used to schedule &#8211; been  drawn from his new work of the last year or so. Actually, Tillmans is  constantly taking pictures in one way or another, although he says he is  still never sure if he can do it. I joke that the closed shutter is the  photographer&#8217;s equivalent of the writer&#8217;s blank screen.</p>
<p>What has Tillmans seen and captured for us? In this exhibition he has  left to one side for the moment works of the last years entailing  abstract examinations of photographic materiality and process. Instead  he has chosen to self-consciously revisit the aesthetic innovations and  pictorial methods for which he became renowned. For example: the  pictures all come in three standard sizes; nothing is framed, just  scotch-taped or hung on binder clips like banners on the wall; one  picture is repeated somewhere to keep you awake and wink at  photography&#8217;s anti-art reproducibility; and, the hanging gravitates  around a horizon and a virtual grid in which images don&#8217;t fill all of  the gaps but a sense of balance and rationality is conveyed from the  placement.</p>
<p>At the same time, he told me he wanted to aesthetically: &#8220;move the goal  posts a little.&#8221; Aside from changes in subject matter there is a  &#8216;newness&#8217; in these pictures, which involves working with the benefit of  hindsight in order to allow steps forward. There is self-quotation with  twists and developments. A few images of clothes and fabric are case in  point &#8211; his new &#8216;faltenwürfe&#8217; (crease or fold) pictures point in two  directions, one which evokes the absent bodies and the other which  suggests they would be happy to dissolve onto another plane, perhaps one  of pure abstraction. Up to this point I have intentionally avoided his  new subjects because lazy-looking involves reducing pictures to labels.  Here is a problematic list of some: the leaning tower of Pisa, grey  relentless guest worker&#8217;s housing in Dubai seen from a plane, the  security barrier in Jerusalem, a rack full of tabloid magazines, a pile  of eggs in cartons, the folds of a rain-proof jacket, South East Asian  small businesses, a man cleansing in the river Ganges, and a computer  room in a research station monitoring climate change. But there are  many, many more, each one particular and stand-alone.</p>
<p>For some days before typing this now I was wondering how to avoid  writing this sentence: Wolfgang Tillmans&#8217;s new exhibition addresses life  on the planet now. He would never claim that and somehow that version  sounds awful like it should be read by a voiceover baritone, but at  least it gets around the now empty sounding &#8216;global&#8217; view. Let&#8217;s keep it  simple &#8211; Tillmans has made and collected a bunch of fine pictures from  all over the place. He told me he liked the possibilities and the  problems of a certain amount of randomness in subject matter and  selection. He wrote to me:</p>
<p><em>In a way to reconcile or address the randomness of the world today is  the biggest task, to let it all in, but still hold course. Colour help  me! It&#8217;s a pure seeing I&#8217;m interested in the mind being stretched by  trying to pull this world of pictures together, like a bit of a  screw-up. Eat this! Previous shows also often included absurd moments  and odd subject matter that had nothing to do with the core narrative of  the &#8216;real&#8217; utopias portrayed in my pictures. But this show reverses the  balance &#8211; a few pictures from &#8216;my world&#8217; are met with a majority of  &#8216;outside&#8217; world.</em></p>
<p>Thus these pictures are worldly but it is not a glamorous world. When  they show economy, power, capital &#8211; whether monstrously built, in  violent action or advertising its things &#8211; it is from a distance or with  dry sarcasm or with a firmly held mirror. When they show people &#8211; sexy  out-of-it friends or strangers in crowds regardless of their milieu &#8211;  they create intimacy, win your sympathy or represent freedom. When they  show things and surfaces and light hinting things and surfaces they  celebrate really, really looking and looking again and the ancillary art  of composition whether we are thinking of fruit or a bunch of lines.</p>
<p>Not shying from either the socio-political difficult or the fatigued  iconography of everyday subjects Tillmans makes striking picture-making  look easy. He allows recognition, identification, familiarity and  discovery. He likes his pictures to be affective, to be good, embedded  in them is belief.</p>
<p><em>Hamburger Bahnhof&#8217;s extensive retrospective of Wolfgang Tillmans&#8217;s  work, shown in Berlin in 2008, was accompanied by an exhibition  catalogue, &#8220;Lighter,&#8221; of the same name, comprising installation views by  Tillmans and others of his exhibitions and installations over the  course of the last 20 years.  Later that year he curated an exhibition  of his own work with pieces from the collection at the Stedelijk Museum,  Amsterdam, Netherlands. Tillmans was included in Life on Mars: Carnegie  International 2008 at the Carnegie Museum of Art, Pittsburgh and in the  53rd Venice Biennale in 2009.  Born in Remscheid, Germany, in 1968,  Wolfgang Tillmans has lived and worked in London since 1990 as well as  since 2004 in Berlin. </em></p>
