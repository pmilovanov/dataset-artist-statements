<p><em>Press Release:</em></p>
<p>Galerie Mezzanin is very pleased to open Michael Hakimi’s first solo  exhibition in Vienna. Despite their semiotic character and clear forms,  in a variety of ways Michael Hakimi’s works create connections to their  surroundings and the contexts which determine them. Relationships to  space, bodies, the conditions of perception and to each other, which are  always expressed in new forms, intersect in them.</p>
<p>However, the works in this cross of coordinates repeatedly attempt to  reflect on a horizon beyond the gallery walls far above their concrete  local references and their limits. In the process representation and  narration can be observed in development, but the question is also posed  as to how far political issues can be addressed or even described at  all by means of a grammar of forms.</p>
<p>Like the title &#8220;Connecting the Dots&#8221;, the exhibition itself appears  able to be read in two different directions.The first would be  morphological which to all intents and purposes casts lots with the  forms in a way that arranges somewhat mercurial series of permutations  between a circle and a square and establishes the changes of meaning  occurring in the process. Whereas the other reading attempts to allow  the resulting meanings and their sometimes extremely charged symbolism  to merge into narration.</p>
<p>One reading appears to torpedo the credibility of the other or even  drive it into absurdity in their respectively very suggestive but  seemingly mutually exclusive appearance. When, for example, a story of a  street fight and contested media (it is presumably not a complete  coincidence that such a constellation is reminiscent of the events after  the Iranian presidential elections in summer 2009) is so to speak  organised in “visual rhymes”. However, on closer inspection it can be  seen that in addition to this conflict between readings there are also  fine transitions in which the relationship between form and content  appears to be open for a moment in its dichotomy but also  inseparability.</p>

<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>Michael Hakimi: Connecting the Dots</p>
<p>Hans Jürgen Hafner</p>
<p>Places where threads converge. Where there is a concentration of  things that come heading towards each other from all possible and  impossible directions. We would like to believe that these places offer a  greater overview than others. Where things connect that remain  unconnected elsewhere, which otherwise possibly happens without any  prospect of mutual acquaintance, without knowing about each other.</p>
<p>It is now only the name of the Berlin underground station  Gleisdreieck (literally “rail triangle”) that is reminiscent of its  original function. The original tracks, which were on the same level and  connected the Anhalt, Dresden and Potsdam lines in the form of a  triangle, were rebuilt in the 1910s into a two-level station with tracks  crossing each other at different levels.</p>
<p>Today the lines U1 and U2 cross each other at Gleisdreieck on the two  levels of the viaducts. In addition, from north to south a  long-distance railway line in an underground tunnel cuts through the  site, which is however largely impassable for road traffic and  pedestrians. The paradox in this is that a huge number of people passes  Gleisdreieck every day without being able to gather any information  about Gleisdreieck as a place. Road traffic is directed around the site  located between Schöneberg and Kreuzberg. Streets which lead to  Gleisdreieck, such as Schöneberger Kurfürstenstrasse, end as a  cul-de-sac. It is just as impossible to get off a train and leave the  station at Gleisdreieck. This place is a non-place. The paths of many  people converge here but only to separate again immediately.  Coincidental point  of intersection. Loose threads.</p>
<p>With “Connecting the Dots“ Michael Hakimi (b. 1968) very precisely  describes his first Vienna solo exhibition. Which could sound a little  like a promise. A promise that we would perhaps also expect from an  exhibition in any case. Ultimately threads usually come together in an  exhibition. It represents a place in which works which are normally  created independently or perhaps even with a view to potential income  must at least be able to “get on together” temporarily. Here they do in  fact make contact with each other. They could indeed do nothing else.  Nevertheless, for its part the exhibition forms a framework of another  order in which something (perhaps exactly what is expected or something  completely different?) promises to happen.</p>
<p>Hakimi’s works are repeatedly described as acts of formalisation. How  he checks information for its semiotic character, form and substance  and signs for their ability to represent and communicate. This sounds  like a considerably “more abstract” arrangement than it really need be.  (It is however an arrangement which can most certainly be found in the  first impression triggered by his works and the exhibition tableaux in  which he brings these works together. Words such as “reduced”,  “concentrated” and “simplified” – but also “code-like” or “enigmatic”  trip quite easily from the tongue to describe it.) However, the  impression of the simplified-abstract should not conceal the fact that  Michael Hakimi’s deliberations take place, so to speak, close to  material. Acts of formalisation can take place with hand movements, with  the help of a saw or with a mouse click in the Photoshop tool box. They  are a result of formal, technical and conceptual search filters. They  can just as easily be exemplified in a stencilled silhouette in glowing  colours on a black background as exchanged for the association of a  dramatically illuminated landscape.</p>
<p>In precisely the same way as material, from the sole of a shoe to the  sign, media play a special role for Hakimi’s works in a literal as well  as figurative sense. To this end material and medium often enter into  precarious alliances. Where and how it can happen that meaning becomes  concrete (or otherwise vanishes somewhere). What constitutes a sign  physically or under what agreement it must occur so that it either  conveys an important message or simply precisely presents a little of  what it is. What would be thought of the powerful crowing gestures of  the victor as long as bullets are flying around his ears?</p>
<p>On the one hand ”Connecting the Dots“ creates very fragile and partly  quite obvious nodal points. What probably play no special role are the  limits of taste. A fragile dialectic connects material and media, forms  and signs. And after various directions, threads, surplus remains and  productive connecting points protrude. Some things “see” themselves  considerably more simply than they could be precisely “read” as facts.  How complicated it can become mainly depends upon our willingness. But  it can always become complicated. And that is not so bad.</p>
